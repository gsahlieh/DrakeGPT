Late-night when you need my love

I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin with some girls I never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just dont get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you dont belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin with some girls Ive never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if youre bendin over backwards for someone else
Wonder if youre rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin nasty for someone else
You dont need no one else
You dont need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, youre someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love

Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
Im talkin about dark room, perfume, go, go
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you aint never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
Youre in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And yall curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, dont approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that aint good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
Less I write it down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
I really hope you play this, cause ol girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations youve been takin
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it dont make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out youre gonna need someone
When you figure out its alright here in the city
And you dont run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write em down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin sure my punctuation curve, every letter heres true
Livin my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
Im talkin poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, its you lookin in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, its you lookin for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin, sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, its coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, thats your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and youll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
Im gon ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem.
Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?
Yo, I dont care who this nigga over here for
If he dont tell me where he from, its a wrap! Im sorry.
Hol up, hol up, hol up, we gon do it like this, okay?
Ima tell you where Im from, okay?
You gon tell me where you from, okay?
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?
Enough with all this talkin.

Im really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Cant get no more free, Randy
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I dont even know how much I really made, I forgot, its a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga dont watch that cause I—
Came up, thats all me, stay true, thats all me 
No help, thats all me, all me for real
Came up, thats all me, stay true, thats all me 
No help, thats all me, all me for real
Money on my mind, you should think the same
Js on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we dont ball the same
 She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, Baby girl, fall in line
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, Id be arrested 
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I dont even know how much I really made, I forgot, its a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga dont watch that cause I—
Came up, thats all me, stay true, thats all me
No help, thats all me, all me for real
Came up, thats all me, stay true, thats all me
No help, thats all me, all me for real
I touched down in 86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie dont play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
Goddamn, aint no wishing over on this side
Yall dont fuck with us, then we dont fuck with yall
Its no different over on this side
Goddamn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself:
Youre the motherfucking man, you dont need no help
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Yall keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear yall just wasting yall breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, Ima make it last forever
It’s not your turn cause I aint done yet
Look, just understand that Im on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, goddamn!
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I dont even know how much I really made, I forgot, its a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga dont watch that cause I—
Came up, thats all me, stay true, thats all me
No help, thats all me, all me for real
Came up, thats all me, stay true, thats all me—
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what Ive been through
Im finna do what I didnt do
And still waking up like the rents due
Not complicated, its simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes Im everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time 
Man, I guess Im just old fashioned
Wearing retro sh—, thats old fashion
Nigga, see what Im saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one
I got 99 problems, getting rich aint one
Like I got trust issues
Im sorry for the people Ive pushed out
Im the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But thats just me and I aint perfect
I aint a saint but I am worth it
If its one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it aint working
Lil bitch...
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
Fore the end of this year
Ill do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like its legalized
Girl, you cant always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that
They aint never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
 I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man

Whats up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, youve been caught up
With them bitches, I dont get it, youre a star, love
You shouldnt have to deal with that
Id never make you feel like that
Cause
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
Thats why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when youre submissive
Passive aggressive when were texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but dont make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation thats lacking in patience
Ive been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
Weve been talking bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that niggas amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, Im in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?
You dont even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something Im missing and disappear when Im bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
Thats why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love
Uh, thinking bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my mommas debit
A weak attempt at flexing, Ill never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how Ill never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy, was she wrong
That was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now its therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macys where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
Ive always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, whats the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isnt?
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out
I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how Im living, I just hope Im forgiven
It seem like you dont want this love anymore
Im acting out in the open, its hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
Thats why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasnt you, you would be dissin you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what youre talkin bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost em at
But maybe I aint lose em at all
Maybe I keep movin forward and theyre just stagnant
They aint movin at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe Im searchin for the problems
Askin what was said and who was involved
Too focused on peoples feedback and provin em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot its on
These days feel like Im squeezin in em
Whoever wore em before just wasnt thinkin big enough
Im bout to leave em with em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin
No pun intended but theyre smellin defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin me there?
They tell him that hes talkin crazy but he doesnt care
Bein humble dont work as well as bein aware
Listen up, boy, youre better off eavesdroppin
We already got spring 2015 poppin
PND droppin, Reps-up P droppin
Majid Jordan droppin, OB droppin, not to mention me droppin
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names

Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense

Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we dont fuck with

Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in
Like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me

Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether its disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didnt study the game to the letter
And understand that Im not doin it the same
Man, Im doing it better
Like I didnt make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I dont know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought Fuck it, its worth it to share em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound
But I think shes straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldnt have
In the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, Im his artist
He probably wouldnt remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldnt believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause its somethin to do
Yeah, I guess thats just who I became, dawg

Im the fuckin man, yall dont get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like Im Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke Im out in Miami too
Clubbin hard, fuckin women, there aint much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up on Biscayne
Still gettin brain from a thang, aint shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
Twenty-five, sitting on twenty-five mil, uh
Im in the building and Im feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, Ima do it for the Bay, okay
Gettin paid, well holler whenever that stop
My team good, we dont really need a mascot
Tell Tune light one, pass it like a relay
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if Im fucking with her, I dont really need her
Aww, thats how you feel, man? Thats really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she wont, then again, maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, whats up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once, thats the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we dont really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Cant see em cause the money in the way, real nigga, whats up?
One time, fuck one time
Im callin niggas out like the umpire
Seven grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy, so I swam to her butt
Its Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall, put some weed in that bitch
Thats my MO, add a B to that shit
Im fucked up, tore down
Im twisted, doorknob
Talk stupid, off with your head
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah

Got a drum on the gun, Energizer Bunny

The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed

My grandma just died, Im the man of the house
So every morning Im up ‘cause I cant let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So Im going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, Im that invested, but you cant attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know thats a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, its only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I
Im here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I havent had a good time in a long time, you know I
Im way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed

Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God, I hope they post it, Im blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, Im calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, Im gon swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled, Im blessed
And I was thinking bout starting up my own school, a Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh, yes

Hello?
Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, Im good, you still working?
Tonight, right now?
Did I go out? Yeah, I went out, I went
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit
Wine or water?
Did you say something about a cold drink? I dont know
Im delirious
Cups of the rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
Ive been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But Ive been drinkin so much
That Ima call her anyway and say
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you pick up, I know hes not around, oh, oh

Tell me, have you heard that lately?
Im just sayin you could do better
And Ill start hatin only if you make me

Flights in the morning

Ive been drinkin so much
That Ima call you anyway and say
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you pick up, I know hes not around
Are you drunk right now?
Im just sayin you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
Im just sayin you could do better
And Ill start hatin only if you make me
I think Im addicted to naked pictures
And sittin talkin bout bitches that we almost had
I dont think Im conscious of makin monsters
Outta the women I sponsor til it all goes bad
But, shit, its all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just callin cause they were just leavin
Talk to me, please, dont have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women thats livin off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, Im ashamed
Bet that you know them, I wont say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
Ive had sex four times this week, Ill explain
Havin a hard time adjustin to fame
Sprite in there mixed up
Ive been talkin crazy, girl, Im lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on

Her white friend said, You niggas crazy, I hope no one heard that

Uh
All my exes live in Texas like Im George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told em dont even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only hello or a happy belated
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And thats when she text me and told me she prayed it
And thats when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her Im faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
I learned workin with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though its fucked up, girl, Im still fuckin with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past
Theres women to call, theres albums to drop, theres liquor involved
Theres stories to tell, we been through it all, damn
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin right, fuckin right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin right, fuckin right, alright
Uh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like aint no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin
And started undressin and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now shes texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasnt married
Promises, I hope I never break em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah

My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like theyre just happier than us these days
Yeah
These days I dont know how to talk to you
I dont know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh

You take my love for granted
I just dont understand it

I feel bad for asking

We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it

You got somebody other than me
Dont play the victim when youre with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you

Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between Im sober and Im lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl, I always stay down
Get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in, they dont even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin they can say now
Nothin really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin was the same
I still been drinkin on the low, mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low, smokin on the low
I still been plottin on the low, schemin on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know
I just been drinkin on the low, mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low, smokin on the low
I just been plottin on the low, schemin on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know
And I hate that you dont think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I cant change what happened
I cant help it, I cant help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one elses
And now you hate me, stop pretendin, stop that frontin, I cant take it
Girl, dont treat me like a stranger, girl, you know I seen you naked
Girl, you know that I remember, dont be a pretender
Gettin high at the condo, thats when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin, girl, and you might feel like nothin was the same
I still been drinkin on the low, mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low, smokin on the low
I still been plottin on the low, schemin on the low

I just been drinkin on the low, mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low, smokin on the low

Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin
Naked women swimmin, thats just how Im livin
Donate a million to some children, thats just how Im feelin
A nigga fillin up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, yall niggas build to destroy
Yall niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you aint feel it before

All she ever say is, Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You dont ever come to me, you dont ever come to me
I been up for two whole days thinkin what I did to keep you goin
Thumbin through the voicemails that you left me tellin me where I went wrong
Ill admit Im sorry when I feel Im truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded, no 
And I believed you when they told me dont
But either way youre still invited and I cant even lie to you
Swear these days all you say is, Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You dont ever come to me, you dont ever come to me
All she hit me with is, Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once, oh
You dont ever come to me, you dont ever come to me
Why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just cause he got a heart dont mean he got heart
Could be standin in a field, and he still aint in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questionin what you get out the deal
Doin things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when Im comin home?
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I dont even know what things are looking like inside of your place
Or how its decorated
This thing is gettin one-sided, I cant even lie to you right now
Yeah
All she talkin bout is, Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once

Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, youre gettin all your friends and youre gettin in the car
And youre comin to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of em
I dont trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other 
Talkin filets with the truffle butter

You know, dont you?

Ask me how to do it, I dont tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I cant let a wack nigga get near me

And I aint takin that back, cause I meant it
You know, dont you?
Yeah

You know, dont you?
Yeah
Night of
Uh, thinkin out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile

Bank teller flirtin after checkin my account
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low, you aint gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning, cause she gon say I know
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
Ill put one leg on the tub, girl, this my new dance move
I just dont know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancing with the stars
I aint nothin like your last dude
Whats his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
Im so heartless, thoughtless, lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, Im gnarly, Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie
You know!
You know, dont you?
Yeah
Night of

Theres no need for us to rush it through
Dont think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Done sayin Im done playin
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
Ive been stackin up like Im fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls
And they end up on them front pages
Im quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, Ill be done with it
Im the only one thats putting shots up
And like a pot luck, you need to come with it, dont run from it
Like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it one hundred
Met a lot of girls in my times there
Word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year
Man, I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in 09 like, Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin
Fore I show up there and theres no one there?
These days, I could probably pack it
For like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, Ive been stressed out
Talkin to her like back then they didnt want me, Im blessed now
Talkin to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, Take a deep breath
Youre too worried about being the best out
Dont think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
Theres no need for us to rush it through
Dont think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Uh, someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin
Theres issues at hand that were not discussin
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now hes actin like, Oh, well, this is life, I guess
Nah, fuck that shit
Listen, man, you can still do what you wanna do
You gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign
Thats when they appear
Guess since my text message didnt resonate, Ill just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment
Telling herself that shes too sick to get dressed up and go do shit
Like thats true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that Ive been round
Started treating me like Im him now
Like we dont know each other, we aint grow together
We just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down
Pick the pen up or put the pen down?
Im writing to you from a distance like a pen-pal
But weve been down
Dont think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
Theres no need for us to rush it through
Dont think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Oh, dont think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
Theres no need for us to rush it through, oh
Dont think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, oh, oh
Dont give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethins gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause Im such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well, if its all a dream
Then Im on fire, feels like, Im on fire

I get 2 million a pop and that’s standard for me
Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me
Prayed, then I prayed again 
Had a moment but it came and went
You don’t wanna play with him 
They’ll be mournin you like 8AM 
Pinky ring til I get a wedding ring 
Love my brothers, cut em in on anything 
And you know its King Slime Drizzy, damn 
She just said Im bae, I hit the thizzle dance 
Either hand is the upper hand 
Got a bubba on my other hand 
This shit aint no hundred bands 
Palace look like Buckingham
Bills so big, I call em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin me but Im resilient, for real
I can’t go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents 
A big part of me resents
Niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got and, man, its hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin on, I gotta represent 
My head is spinnin, from smokin the chicken, the bass is kickin
My head is spinnin, from smokin the chicken, the bass is kickin

Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess Im just New Orleans
And I will never stop like Im runnin from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, To the top
Life is such a fuckin roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park

Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
Hes wonderin if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He aint had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo
Bashin in the brains of these hoes
And establishin a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You cant put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That Im talkin about when we riot
You dealin with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, hows it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin the consequence
Drinkin every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, Im floatin in and out of consciousness
And they sayin Im back, Id agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, whered I leave it at?

Tuck my napkin in my shirt cause Im just mobbin like that
You know good and well that you dont want a problem like that

Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, They miss the old Drake, girl, dont tempt me
If they dont get it, theyll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
Im like, Why I gotta be all that?
But still, I cant deny the fact that its true
Listening to you expressin all them feelings
Soap-opera rappers, all these niggas sound like all my children
And thats who you thinkin is bout to come and make a killin?
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions
You know that they aint even got it like that
You gon hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this, it isnt just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it, I aint even gotta say it, they know
They know, they know, they know

I know youve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, heres what Ill do
Ill take care of you 
Ive loved and Ive lost
Ive asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didnt change and I still feel the same
Whats a life with no fun? Please dont be so ashamed
Ive had mine, youve had yours, we both know, we know
They wont get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you cant sleep thinkin that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, aw
Pushing me away so I give her space, aw
Dealin with a heart that I didnt break
Ill be there for you, I would care for you
I keep thinking you just dont know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just dont show
When youre ready, just say youre ready
When all the baggage just aint as heavy
And the partys over, just dont forget me
Well change the pace and well just go slow
You wont ever have to worry
You wont ever have to hide
And youve seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes
Cause if you let me
Heres what Ill do
Ill take care of you 
Ive loved and Ive lost
Its my birthday, Ill get high if I want to
Cant deny that I want you, but Ill lie if I have to
Cause you dont say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that youre followin your heart
Cause your mind dont control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, dont be so ashamed
Ive had mine, youve had yours, we both know, we know
You hate bein alone, well, you aint the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody shouldve told you somethin
To save you, instead, they say
Dont, tell me, I dont care if you hurt
I dont, tell you, you dont care if youre true
Dont, tell me, I dont care if you hurt
I dont, tell you, you dont care if youre true

When a good thing goes bad, its not the end of the world
Its just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And shes the reason it happened, but shes overreacting
And its all because she dont want things to change
So cry if you need to, but I cant stay to watch you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I cant stay to hold you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I cant stay to hear you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Cause youll say you love me, and Ill end up lying
And say, I love you too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
Somethings been missing
You know it, oh, she knows it
Oh, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
Oh, oh
We live in a generation of not being in love and not being together
But we sure make it feel like were together
Cause were scared to see each other with somebody else
So cry if you need to, but I cant stay to watch you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I cant stay to hold you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I cant stay to hear you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Cause youll say you love me, and Ill end up lying
And say, I love you too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
Somethings been missing
You know it, oh, she knows it
Oh, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
Oh, oh

Silence keeps cloudin me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered
Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin but got pictures with me smilin though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I dont want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin at the studio
I dont have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and thats just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what Im on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because Im generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin up we just laugh about it
Cant describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep til mornin on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin
Seasons go by like Im binge-watchin
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin up at a club less we doin biz
I cant even party while a nigga pursuin this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So theres more for them and theres less for me
They dont know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No ones done it successfully
7AM in Germany, cant believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin to let go of anything thatll burden me
Thats the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, its always executed perfectly
If we do a song its like takin my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that Im in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, cause theres other shit thats concernin me
Theres real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmothers his surety
He cant even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered round competition and currency
Takin summer off, cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin back to my regular life will humble me
Ill be back 2018 to give you the summary

Ooh, ooh
Woah, yeah
Ooh 
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
Theres a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This aint no fuckin sing-along
So, girl, what you singin for?
Its cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin like a C4
Twenty, keep the bar rollin
Fake IDs in the trash, we goin
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash comin straight from Poland
Why? Cause they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew, woah
Yeah
Smokin weed under star projectors
I guess well never know where Harvard gets us
But seein my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who Im becoming
Theres times where I might do it just to do it like its nothing
Theres times where I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers, just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones thatll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say, Your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story and made history
Tell them Ima need reservations for twenty
Ive never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Id much rather spend it all while Im breathin
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, oh
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Woah
Cause we blowin like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin like a C4

Your heart is hard to carry after dark
Youre to blame for what we could have been
Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that its always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And Im going back there tonight
And you know whats on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know whats on my mind so
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
Out of body
Thats just how I feel when Im around you, shawty
Last night we didnt say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, Im on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
Im not scared of it, she aint either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
Cause you know whats on my mind so
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But very much 6AM
Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin
Yeah, yeah, fam

Yeah
Yeah
Man
Its like 09 in your basement and Im in love with Nebby
And I still love her, but it fell through because I wasnt ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt and you smokin heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it, and we argue about spendin money on bullshit
And you tell me Im just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now its fuck you, I hate you, Ill move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me and you tell me that you sorry
And you love me and I love you and your heart hurts, mine does too
And its just words and they cut deep, but its our world, its just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldnt have worked this hard if you were healthy and it werent so bad, uh
Maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
Well probably end up robbin a bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasnt that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh, its my time, yeah, its on
Hes thinkin of signin me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son, man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
And get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shouldve known
Cause you deserve it
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what youve done, look what youve done
Look what youve done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon be somethin
When youre stressed out and you need somethin, I got you, yeah
Look what youve done, look what youve done
Look what youve, look what youve
Its like 06 in your backyard, Im in love with Jade
And Im still in love cause when its that real is when it doesnt fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he cant come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasnt paid, damn
Boohoo, sad story, Black American dad story
Know that Im your sisters kid, but it still dont explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you, man, this all new shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fightin going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think Im done acting
Now Im more in touch with the music
You said, either way, Id be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, then you got to me
Then youd toss the keys and loan me your car, yeah
Just a young kid in a drop-top Lexus hopin that I dont get arrested
Just another kid thats going through life so worried that I wont be accepted
But I could do anything
You said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced, but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I dont know where Id really be without that
It worked out, man, you deserve it
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what youve done, look what youve done
Look what youve done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon be somethin
When youre stressed out and you need somethin, I got you, yeah
Look what youve done, look what youve done
Look what youve, look what youve
Hi Aubrey
Im here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knew, knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this
In this comfortable place
All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together
And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feeling about that
So God bless you

 Uh
 Uh
 Uh
 I
I just love when Im with you
Yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and youd tell me
Baby, its yours, nobody elses
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
Its yours, nobody elses
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it
They say its yours, nobody elses
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
Its yours, nobody elses
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
Its yours, its yours, its yours, its yours
Thats for sure, thats for sure 
Its yours, its yours, its yours, its yours
Thats for sure, thats for sure
How you feel about
Comin home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights
I know we only fuckin out of spite cause your man dont
Do you right, do you right
I could fuck you so good, then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas
Who you like, baby, who you like?
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it aint about who did it first
Its bout who did it right, niggas looking like Preach
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that its harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didnt have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I dont know whats getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You aint ever worried cause hes not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life, and this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin with me mentally, I think its meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin boys
But you gotta understand when its yours
They dont really leave your ass with a mothafuckin choice, man
I, I just love when Im with you
Yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and youd tell me, baby
Its yours, nobody elses
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
Its yours, nobody elses
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it
They say its yours, nobody elses
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
Its yours, nobody elses
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
Its yours, its yours, its yours, its yours
Thats for sure, thats for sure 
Its yours, its yours, its yours, its yours
Thats for sure, thats for sure
How you feel about?

Yeah, views, views, views
Yeah, yeah, alright
Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
Ive been counted out so many times, I couldnt count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Paybacks a bitch and you know that shit
Yall niggas gettin too old for this
Please dont think nobody notices
Ive been up for way too many days
Yall sleep enough for me anyway
Yall dont be doin shit anyway
Yall are not true to this anyway

Diced pineapple
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky wont catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I aint no connoisseur but Im, kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya, Im tryin to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I aint talking bout no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna, give you whats better than better
The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or, temporary forevers
Shorty get it together, hah, diced pineapple
May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay til you need five and
Tell me shorty you got it baby
If its not it baby, hope its progress baby
Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby
No more talking baby
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, damn, my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib, Im just stuntin on her ex
Pussys excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as Im lickin on her flesh 
Sex all night, couple shots of CIROC
Crib on the water, got LeBron up the block
Money aint the thing, baby, welcome to the mob
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sing
Her uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team
Double MG, them other niggas fell off
Baby girl, I just wanna see you well off
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, dont it girl?

When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right, aww yeah

Roll up some sour, let me kiss on her fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I wont ever rest, we meet at the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol up, showing off some Agent Provocateur
Rushing you out your drawers though patiently get you off
Hate when they be too anxious though, hate when they be too dull
Like to go deep but I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you? Let me see some proof
Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is we, we don’t need no room
Right now I’m trying to eat, and we don’t need a spoon
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, dont it girl?
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back

Say youre moving on, well, I guess thats just the motion
I guess thats just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess thats just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess thats just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess thats just the motion
I dont have a fuck to give, Ive been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like its 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, thats my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, thats where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling cause they want me on their song
Its like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they dont leave you alone
But I guess thats just the motion, yeah
Then that phone doesnt ring
When they got everything, thats the motion
Oh-oh, I guess thats just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess thats just the motion
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
Cause we said no strings attached and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So Im with her even when Im here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Dont even know how to help, but I guess thats just the motion, yeah
Shell probably come around
Soon as I settle down, thats the motion
Oh-oh, I guess thats just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess thats just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess thats just the motion
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess thats just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess thats just the motion
I guess thats just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess thats just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess thats just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess thats just the motion

Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain?
Youll see new heights you’ll be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Yeah, I couldnt get a bill paid
You couldnt buy the real thing
I was stayin’ up at yo place
Tryin to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin home shit
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

If you fuckin with my opps, just dont come near me 
Put some bands all on your head like Jason Terry 
Richard Mille cost a Lambo 
Known to keep the baddest bitches on commando

Saw you last night, but did it broad day

Im in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay
So if you rebuke me for workin with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga thats makin your beats?
Ive done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours then let him repeat
Now you poppin up with the jokes, Im dead, Im asleep
I just left from over by yall puttin pen to the sheets
Tired of sittin quiet and helpin my enemies eat
Keep gettin temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Dont know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Mustve had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Yall are the spittin image of whatever jealousy breeds
Dont push me when Im in album mode
Youre not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle
And hold him back cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to they higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think its good that now the teachers are learnin, yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin, then him, then you
So, you dont rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Dont be ashamed, its plenty niggas that do what you do
Theres no malice in your heart, youre an approachable dude
Man, you mightve sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the 80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles whats been happenin lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger workin double time
Yall actin like he made the boy when I was tryna help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly makin me hits
But then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it
My spirit did it, Im fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldnt have given you none of my time
Cause you older than the nigga you runnin behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playin with my name
And Ima let it ring on you like Virginia Williams
Im too resilient, get out your feelings
Its gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and Baby, Ima done him for you
Tell Ye we got a invoice comin to you
Considerin that we just sold another 20 for you
To be honest

Yeah
We got London on da Track
This is all Gods doin, man, you cant plan it
But if the devils in the details, then Im Satanic
Bout to take over your city and you cant stand it
My accountant say you sinkin like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitchin underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talkin, I dont understand it
You aint own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man, Im only twenty-nine, have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label, nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga 
Shit aint been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more
FaceTime with my shawty on tour

Niggas keep reachin and dissin

You gon make me call my bros for assistance 
Make me call my bro 
Baby, Im a savage, I aint romantic

And they pockets goin under like the Titanic
Got some head last night and it was outstandin
They was hatin on me then and they hatin now 
She was playin with me then but she waitin now 
Used to sleep inside a den, I got acres now 
I was fightin niggas then but Im sprayin now 
I dont pay no mind to no sneak diss 
I wont spend a dime on a freak bitch 
Niggas takin cheap shots on some cheap shit 
They the type to stand in line for some free shit 
Baby girl gon suck it till her jaws locked 
She gon make me put my bitch on call block 
We the ones poppin, we the ones shoppin 
We the one droppin niggas, we the ones 
They the ones duckin when them heaters come

And Im sellin out arenas but you puttin on a show
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know
Cause if I dont share the wealth
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow?
Moms stressed, theres a lot of things we need
Chain smokin in the house, its hard to breathe
I used to have to hit my Ts with Febreze
Jordan pull up in the TL, now Im cheese
Ima turn this TSX into a Benz soon
Ima see a lot of blessins for my friends soon
Hunnid-fifty-inch screen in my bedroom
61, man, a nigga need some leg room
Shit aint been the same like before
They aint even wanna look up at the score
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin purple hearts cause she know that we at war, yuh
Niggas keep reachin and dissin
Cant afford mistakes, not on this end

You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it thats got you all gassed up? 
Changin your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you dont have the time to wait on me
I tried with you
Theres more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didnt sit right with you, yea
And now youre tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now youre throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now youre talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you dont feel no way, you think I deserve it
Worlds, worlds, worlds famous
Worlds, worlds, worlds famous
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Ive stopped listenin to things you say
Cause you dont mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way
I tried with you
Theres more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you

Theres three balls and a strike
Heres the pitch
Its belted deep to center
Revere goes back, jumps at the wall, and its gone!
Yeah, isnt it amazing
How you talk all this shit and we still lack communication?
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I dont need convincing
How every conversation starts with, This time will be different
Oh, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends, if youre looking for me
Same city, same friends, if youre looking
Ill be here, just swanging
Dont talk to me like Im famous
And dont assume, cause I dont respect assumptions, babe
Im just tryna connect with somethin, babe
Yeah, swanging
Ayy
She just wanna run around the city
And make memories that she can barely remember
And Id allow her
Talk about pussy power 
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in a eighteen-wheeler
And Id allow her
Talk about pussy power
She used to say, You can be whoever you want, even yourself
Yeah, I show up knowin exactly who I was
And never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, Im always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends if youre looking for me
Same city, same friends if youre looking
Ill be here, just swanging 
Dont talk to me like Im famous 
And dont assume cause I dont respect assumptions, bae
Im just tryna connect with somethin, baby
Ill be here, just swanging 
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 East
And exit at Markham Road in the East End
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired, I renew it after the weekend
Fuck, I know I said that shit the last seven weekends
Girl, I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin for gas this late
Cause theres niggas creepin and not like how were creepin
Summer is comin, know you could feel it
Twenty on pump, whatever, I aint got enough to fill it
Wont knock on your door
My uncle say, You drive my whip like its yours
I got the pedal to the floor
Im on my motherfuckin way, swangin
Dont fall asleep on me, hang in there
Ill be there, just swangin
Ill be there, just swangin
I treat you good, girl, like youre famous
I know Im late, its always the same shit
But dont fall asleep on me, hang in there

Yeah
We had the type of nights where mornin comes too soon
And nothin was the same
Watch me, goin out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We aint spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that aint too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through

Girl you know we got thangs to do

Yeah, last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard workin goin on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin goin on?
Someone put a order in for a chicken 
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen 
Yeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?
Rap game, crack game, aint that different, ya know?
Last album had it boomin somethin vicious, ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when its late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do

Im gettin twenty million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga, thats a record
Im livin like Im out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin for the radio, but theyll still play it though
Cause its that new Drizzy Drake, thats just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga
Rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where dont shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldnt reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
Yeah, Im just as famous as my mentor
But thats still the boss, dont get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasnt meant for
Cause you dont really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Heres a reason for niggas thats hatin without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I dont have to tell em that Im rich
Self-explanatory, you just here to spread the story
Wassup?
Sittin Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money, nothin you could tell me
Paperwork takin too long, maybe they dont understand me
Ill compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin to Nicki, communication is breakin
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
Im honest, I make mistakes, Id be the second to admit it
Think thats why I need her in my life, to check me when Im trippin
On a mission, tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin, I got some things thatll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin
All of the talkin, got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, Im too busy, thats why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like ayy, B, I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My lifes a completed checklist
Im tired of hearin bout who you checkin for now
Just give it time, well see whos still around a decade from now
Thats real
How much time is this nigga spendin on the intro?
Lately Ive been feelin like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, Im just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote, we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna 
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these nineties fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if youre fine
Thats just me on my solo like Fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, Accept yourself
You dont have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin on the intro?
How this nigga workin like he got a fuckin twin though?
Life is soundin crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldnt change a thing if you paid me
Now real nigga, wassup?
Ayy, yeah, ayy
How much time is this nigga spendin on the intro?
If theres hell below, Ill see you when you get there
Are you enjoyin yourselves?
If we may, we would just like to close off with somethin a bit inspirational
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years
It dont mean that we cant have a good life
So wed like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us

Dirt and grime and filth inside
The story of my lifetime
Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother

You was poppin back when Usher wore a U-chain

I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you

Niggas wouldnt make it on this side
Im not new to this, Im not new, Im not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so thats whats up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now

You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This ones for you
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes aint never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon live it up
She made me beg for it til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin best , you the fuckin best 
You the fuckin best , you the fuckin best 
You the best I ever had , best I ever had 
Best I ever had , best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin
Know you got a roommate, call me when theres no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there 
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin all the spots that you aint even know was there
And you dont even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin with no make-up on
Thats when youre the prettiest
I hope that you dont take it wrong
You dont even trip when friends say
You aint bringin Drake along?
You know that Im workin, Ill be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
Im the one that never get confused with, cause
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes aint never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon live it up
She made me beg for it til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin best , you the fuckin best 
You the fuckin best , you the fuckin best 
You the best I ever had , best I ever had 
Best I ever had , best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitchesll buy it for the picture
And niggasll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money aint the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt aint got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin bra strap pop
All up in your slot til a nigga hit the jackpot, Im saying
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes aint never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon live it up
She made me beg for it til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

You the best I ever had , best I ever had 
Best I ever had , best I ever had
Uhh, ah yeah
See, this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money, yeah, yeah
You know who you are

Youve got me feeling emotions
Ayy, higher
Ah
Youve got me fe—
You, oh
Dont link me
Dont hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Dont tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you wont love me until Im gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin on
I cant even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin all my heroes like seein how magic works
The people I look up to are goin from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they dont like that, its written all on they face
I dont know how Ima make it out of here clean
Cant even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin it to extremes
Leavin me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin me to ask whats their motive in makin peace
Leavin me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin me to ask, is there anybody like me?
Youve got me fe—
You, oh
Youve got me fe—
You, oh, ayy
Missin out on my years
Theres times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin out on my days
Scrollin through life and fishin for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see whos there on the other end of the shade
Most times its just somebody thats underaged
Thats probably just alone and afraid
And lashin out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin to give
Cause they been starin at somebody elses version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
Cause all that mattered was impressin everybody shes known
I know another girl thats cryin out for help
But her latest caption is Leave me alone
I know a girl happily married til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places shes flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasnt hidin my kid from the world
I was hidin the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin news in my life, I dont run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, Why let the story run if its false?
You know a wise man once said nothin at all
Im exhausted and drained, I cant even pretend
All these people takin miles when you give em an inch
All these followers but who gon follow me to the end?
I guess Ill make it to the end and Ima find out then
Youve got me fe—
You, ohhhh, ayy
Higher, higher
Youve got me fe—
You, ohhhh, ayy

Stop, stop, stop…
Fuck niggas gon be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up
I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you
I did some charity today for the kids
But Im used to it cause all yall charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin on us without no interrogation
I stay silent cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin, I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact, I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but dont jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin, knew they would push a button
East egg huntin, they gotta look for somethin
Done doin favors for people
Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin trouble goin gold
Turnin into some so-and-sos that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star-struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no, we eatin, niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas aint about to starve us
Im charged up
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky leggin
Trust me, this information is vital
I’m tryin to take the high road, I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s somethin that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We goin live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killin people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up!
Have you seen me? I’m doing so good
Every time we meet: Oh, I’m so sorry
(Fuck niggas gon be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)
You know, I kept it real
It ain’t too many real people out here
And people be on some weak bitch-ass shit all day long
Industry people… regular people…

Yeah
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know?
For my niggas, though
Uh, you underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
Probably wouldnt lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, cant hear em over the laughter
Yeah, thats cause Im headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, Im just bein frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she aint with ya?
Wildin, doin shit thats way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
Thats why every song sound like Drake featurin Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin our words like its wiretaps on the team
Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess its funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin himself
A couple somebodies started killin themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I aint lyin, my nigga, my time is money
Thats why I aint got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin like thats the movement
And Im the only nigga still known for the music, I swear
Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everythings lookin gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eatin like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Josos
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin live from the screwface, livin out a suitcase
But Im feelin good, Johnny got me pushin two plates
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race
Its funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like Ive been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
Im on my King James shit, Im tryna win here again
A young nigga tryna win here again, man, whats up?
Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city Im in
I got her drinkin with your boy

You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, thats a bold move
I know that youre out here
And theres things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just dont love you like I do
Yeah, and they never will
But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel
And I know you cant wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
Thats why youre always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You dont see anybody else
And youre like, Oh well
Youre like, Fuck it, oh well
My past behind me like a ponytail
But you my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, thats a bold move
I know that youre out here
And theres things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just dont love you like I do
Yeah, and they never will
Okay, I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you dont trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things you cant afford for ya?
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you like the car with the strap in it
Thank God thats finished
Cause now its back to business
Any more Henny and youre past the limit
You told me bout the picture, now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, thats a bold move
I know that youre out here
And theres things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just dont love you like I do
And they never will
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, thats a bold move
I know that youre out here
And theres things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just dont love you like I do

People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, Im just proud of the fact that youve done it your way
And the weekends here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If theyre the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, ooh
Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You mustve done this before, this cant be your first time
We mustve been here before, its still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but wont find
You mustve done this before, this cant be your first time
They keep telling me dont save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isnt right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekends here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
Theres things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too
Were perfect for each other
Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You mustve done this before, this cant be your first time
We mustve been here before, its still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but wont find
You mustve done this before, this cant be your first time 
Cause to her, Im just a rapper and soon, shell have met another
So if tonights an accident, tomorrow, well recover
And I know Im not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I dont wan be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her
And she with it if Im with it, and Im with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wan know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
See, I know this aint your first, but its better than your last, Tunechi
You mustve done this before, this cant be your first time
We mustve been here before, its still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but wont find
You mustve done this before, this cant be your first time 
Shower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that ho a scholarship
All of them aint all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in a corner
Like a lab rat, nobody want her
Niggas that are married dont wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in a Boise state
Cant see a play or the team, cause
Everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they dont, souls will later on say to them, That aint true
All of them will have an opinion
But yall know what yall can do with them
But if you unsure, Ill take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you, baby
Someone Like You, more like someone unlike you
Or something thats familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that youre crazy
Oh, what the hell? Nope, cant be lazy

AXL , AXL , AXL 
Woi-oi
Ayy
I dont cop things for resale, dont do iCloud, dont do email
Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin up Teesdale, I was doin dinner with Teezy
I didnt trust no one, swore gyal lined me cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendalls, I was at ends though, dreamin up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie
Cant have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I dont do well with people makin disses or makin threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less
I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then its been stress
Cause you know the rest dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I dont do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps thats rappin, I bet he dont want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know thats been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we cant split up
As for the rest of the game, Ill do man dirty, manll get two time
To me, thats just our side, I dont really care who rides on whose side
Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301, wont spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin outta line, get outlined, and you know Im tied up stateside
Bringin man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has codenames, anyone Im beefin with is a no-name
Niggas cant even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train
Ayy
Yeah

I get em up! 
I get em up! 
I get em up! 
DJ Khaled!
Ugh, Im getting so throwed
I aint went this hard since I was eighteen
Apologize if I say anything I don’t mean
Like, Whats up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And, Whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?
But get it while you here, boy
Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah, and I be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Tripping off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tan and my hair long and my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work, but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit, hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking—watch me take it
All I care about is money and the city that Im from
Ima sip until I feel it, Ima smoke it til its done
I dont really give a fuck and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shouldve told you
I’m on one, yeah
Fuck it, Im on one, yeah
I said, Im on one
Fuck it, Im on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple or could be pink
Pending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and Ima get that shit
Cause Im on one
I said, Fuck it, Im on one
Huh! Im burning purple flowers, it’s burning my chest 
I bury the most cash and burning the rest 
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air 
The ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear 
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills 
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on your neck and tell you, Everything is great 
Even though Im out on bond and might be facing eight
Still running with the same niggas til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully 
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams 
In a room full of money out in London as she screams? 
Huh! Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So, yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair 
And it’s double MG until I get the chair, chyeah

You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, aint nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused, might as well say cheese for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sellout, but I aint buying

Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration, bitches: Mazel tov

But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winters day, hot as a summers eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

She said Im caged in, I think her conscience is
Shes watching that Oxygen, Im watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like its for posters and I poke like Im suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: Dont you ever show this!
Im too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said Your words get me open
So I closed it, where your clothes is?

She aint got a man, but shes not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well

Rich niggas and Im really bein modest

Tired of beefin you bums, you cant even pay me enough to react
Been wakin up in the crib and sometimes I dont even know where Im at
Please dont play that nigga songs in this party, I cant even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isnt a closeable gap, ayy

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby

Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the net
Im like DaBaby, Im not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon get stretched

Knocked that boy off and I dont want no credit
If it was me, they wouldnt regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin, my niggas still eatin
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with em, she spillin the tea

Come with a classic, they come around years later and say its a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didnt even nut for her once, you know Im a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin my sins, he wouldnt believe us
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some Ms, got a lot of Ms on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Im in love, Im in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, thats why I got ten on my mind
I got Ms, got a lot of Ms on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen
Im from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I cant respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasnt bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
Im not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun aint gon jam, when I blow, I aint missin
Im droppin hit after hit, Im just chillin
But Ill send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin me offers
I dont even bargain, Ill start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin day and went harder
Im crackin my shell now, they see that Im smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and ones for her daughter
I cant let em down, walk around with my guard up
Im screamin out YOLO, yeah, thats still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they aint thought of

Its a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me
All of my lets just be friends are friends I dont have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I shouldve tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my lets just be friends are friends I dont have anymore
Guess thats what they say you need family for
Cause I cant depend on you anymore
Always saw you for what you couldve been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you couldve been
And even when its business with you its personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now were meeting our end
And its all because you chose a side
Youre supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasnt time 
And of course you went and chose a side that wasnt mine
Youre so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what Im going through
You cant even figure out whats going on with you
You judge me fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the players anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I dont know whats going on
I dont know whats going on
And its all because you chose a side
Youre supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasnt time 
And of course you went and chose a side that wasnt mine
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause Im living right
When I needed you, you couldnt give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
Im fooding and serving them all
Like Im working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, Ill always love ya; thats how I was raised
Same way Im right here still feeling the way
Same way Im realizing on a day to day that
All of my lets just be friends are friends I dont have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I shouldve tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my lets just be friends are friends I dont have anymore
Guess thats what they say you need your family for
Cause I cant depend on you anymore
Much closer
Any time people want to start problems
Its like “for real, are you dumb?”
You know who mans are
Im not afraid no gyal heart man
And Im not afraid of no cyattie
And Im not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it

Im able to, uh
The stage in my life where Im
Where I feel like I can conquer anything and everything
Sippin on Dom Perignon for no reason
Poppin tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
Ill let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Ballin in the middle of the club, no jersey
I dont want no liquor cause I been drinkin that dirty
Bring that Ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup, my drink with me
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
And you know what I need
From you when I get home 
You better not be on the phone
Talkin up a storm like you usually do
Talkin to your friends like you usually do
Tellin them I never spend time with you
Its hard to find a time, we been
Sippin on Dom Perignon for no reason
Poppin tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
Ill let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Ballin in the middle of the club, no jersey
I dont want no liquor cause I been drinkin that dirty
Bring that Ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup, my drink with me
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Im familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin, you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you can vouch for me
I put the cocaine and the powder in the couch, homie
Whenever I step outside the house, I keep that glocky on me
Bad bitches wanna come by, the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely want her
Im barely paying attention, baby, I need substance
I know you spent some time puttin on your makeup and your outfit, but
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

But that nigga cant save your soul 
Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty
Havent even heard from you 
How can you live with yourself?
I havent even heard from you
How can you live with yourself? 
Ungrateful
Ungrateful 
Your momd be ashamed of you
I havent even heard from you, not a single word from you
Ungrateful 
Im too good for you, too good for you 
You should go back to him, perfect match for you, unstable 
Doing me dirty 
Youre making me nervous
I havent even heard from you
You look drained, you look exhausted
Girl, them late nights aint good for you
Really starting to show on you
Dont hit me up when its good for you

Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shits crazy right now, and shit aint gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better
Look, mama hit my phone and said raps no good
Better than her telling me the checks no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Cant get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but Im down to cut ties for it
And I cant sleep these days unless I take one
If they dont have a story these days, theyll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesnt matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I dont gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, its a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

All these hand outs, man its getting outta hand
Ima start telling niggas Get it how you can
I got it right now so Im everybodys friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, Id die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we cant be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just dont fade away
Six upside down, its a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

… And then when I saw the news
Make me feel afraid of how I’d been to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side

I dont wanna hear all that, I dont wanna hear none of that
Talkin commas, how much you need and all that shit
Fuck that shit, I dont remember none of that shit
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldnt feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didnt need me?

Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where Im at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryin come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin out the stove and we still bangin, honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion
Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all theyd ask was Whats the hold up?
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because were paying back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and the commissary aint gon pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I aint got no choice
Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
Im self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
Ill buy the neighbors house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldnt feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didnt need me?
Where your ass was at? Last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldnt feed me?
Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didnt need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out
60 for a walk through, bitch dont panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason Im here today cause I aint never gave up
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldnt feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didnt need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out
Where you ass was at, when I was trapping in the store?

Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin there talkin bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin suicide, teachers aint testin us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but its OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors, when you cant do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif
How are niggas sposed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, youre finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin round the crib like, Why a nigga cant live?
Get this money, fuck these bitches though?
Thinkin bout the beef like:
We can pass these mothafuckin straps like a physical
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin round town, just me and my four-pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin I aint gotta show it
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggasll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, Im fucked up
Yall better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Yall better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Yall better off realizin theres nothin that yall could do wit me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one
Thank me later, thanks for nothin, thanks for bluffin
Thank you so, so much for wearin your true colors
To every single fuckin function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin off the budget
Now, when I see em, theyre the ones thats actin funny
People been reachin out to me
And Im on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didnt have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didnt go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
Im in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobodys even hearin it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that its a period, sayin to myself
Yall better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Yall better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Yall better off realizin theres nothin that yall could do wit me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one
Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin your nigga though
Cant think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin while drivin down Figuero
Blowin kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, Here it go
Screamin Frog name at the clouds, they dont hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas dont feel me though
That was on Suges watch, Ill take Suges watch
You dissin Drizzy, thats cool, but dont come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
Thats word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggasll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Dont even matter, dawg, cause Ima always be a real nigga

I never learned how to be nothin but a real nigga
Yall better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Yall better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Yall better off realizin theres nothin that yall could do wit me

And when youre fuckin someone else
Just fuck her like she aint me
Damn, those words are scary
Those words are scary, Virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love two years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
Its all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, dont I?
I get off-topic, dont I? I get it poppin, dont I?
Ill end up stoppin, wont I?
And by the time I end up stoppin
Youll be rockin one of the rings that you pointed out while shoppin with a nigga, dont lie
Uh, shes losin it right now

But instead were movin slow, I guess shes used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and Im abusin it right now
But this money comin in is just confusin shit right now
You just told me I aint shit, I guess Im provin it right now, oh
I say Id rather be with you, but you are not around
So Ima call somebody up and see if theyd be down
Cause I hate sleepin alone, I hate sleepin alone
Half the time, we dont end up fucking, I dont ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I dont see her for months
But I just hate sleepin alone, I hate sleepin alone
So shes here and were both so gone
Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight and you come to me
But she dont want a weekend, she wants all of me or none of me
If she cant work with all of me, then she says she done with me
You say that youre over me, you always end up under me
You know how it goes, dont be crazy, dont play dumb with me
Dont start with your shit, I put you back in your place
She tells me, I bet you wont, you wont say that to my face
And hangs up, yeah, how dare you tell me its tougher for you?
Like I dont hear about the niggas you fucking with too?
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
Thats just something to do when theres nothing to do
Yeah, but shes losing it right now
She has choices she should make, I think shes choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think Im using it right now
You just said I never learn, I guess Im proving it right now, oh
I say Id rather be with you, but you are not around
So Ima call somebody up and see if theyd be down
Cause I hate sleepin alone, I hate sleepin alone
Half the time, we dont end up fucking, I dont ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I dont see her for months
But I just hate sleepin alone, I hate sleepin alone
So shes here and were both so gone
Oh, oh
Shes here, were so gone

Why would I say all these things to have you feelin a way?
Why would I tell you Im 30 away if Im not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?—I lost my way
Im searchin for these words to say to you

Oh, please give me time

Damn, Im not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they aint with it then lets just forget it
Relationships slowin me down, they slow down the vision
Guess Im not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me theyre proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it couldve been different
Wonder what theyd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if theyre second guessin their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving
Tryna satisfy everybody, its like they cant get enough
Until enough is enough, and then its too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin
Ill kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedrooms where we get it poppin
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
Im a walkin come-up, Im a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin
Whos gonna save me when I need savin?
Since Take Care, Ive been caretakin
But second chances, that aint how you livin
Redemption on your mind, Ill never be forgiven
Yeah

Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like Im David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin out of my section
OVO on me while yall niggas was playin dress-up
And I know who gon take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
Theyve been sayin its love, but it isnt love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasnt out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin fitteds everyday
Kiddies Caribana, tryin not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“Its only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, thats all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
Im gettin straight to the point with it
Need yall to know that I never needed none of yall niggas
Fuck bein all buddy buddy with the opposition
Its like the front of the plane, nigga, its all business
But I havent flown with yall boys in a minute
Look, theyd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when its 20 below
Who you think runnin this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin in code
I got a pure soul, I dont do the hate
You dont worry bout fittin in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but Ill never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin like Im Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, Id rather get you myself
Runnin through the 6, thumbin through the contracts
Im possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but theyll get it soon
I still got somethin left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like its goin in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, Ill take us wherever
Im a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karmas such a thing of beauty
Id share more of my story but you wouldnt believe it
Its farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like Im running a fever
I might take a breather but I wont ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldnt like me either

Ooh ahh
Ooh ahh, ahh
Ohh yeah, yeah
Ooh ahh, ahh
Why you rushing me, baby?
Its only us, alone
I dont want to die tonight, baby
So lemme sip this slow
Ill give you what you called for
Just let me get in my zone
Ill be making love to her through you
So let me keep my eyes closed
And I wont see a damn thing
I cant feel a damn thing

But Ima touch you right 
Ima touch you right

I dont understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, its the same me
We should be 
Senseless sight to see
Yeah
Senseless sight to see
Ayy
Feelin young but they treat me like the OG
And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosey
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon see
I wont put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you cant control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they cant hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know its me
Imitation isnt flattery, its just annoyin me
And Im too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for yall to figure out what yall gon do about it
Big wheels keep rollin, rollin
Im outside, twenty-nine, G5, seaside
Ive been losin friends and findin peace
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever hurt one and Im still here
Outside, frontline, Southside
Ive been losin friends and findin peace
Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
Look, dont invite me over if you throw another pity party
Lookin back, its hard to tell you where I started
I dont know who love me, but I know that it aint everybody
I can never love her, she a busy body
Baby, if you want me, cant be turnin up with everybody, nah
Cant be fuckin on just anybody, yeah
I got feelings for you, thats the thing about it, yeah
You know that its somethin when I sing about it, yeah
Mama used to be on disability but gave me this ability
And now she walkin with her head high and her back straight
I dont think you feelin me, Im out here
Bein everything they said I wouldnt be and couldnt be
I dont know what happened to them guys that said they would be
I said see you at the top and they misunderstood me
I hold no resentment in my heart, thats that maturity
And we dont keep it on us anymore, its with security

Rollin 84s, it aint no safety
Ridin rich and wavy
Gotta roll over to you, gotta get my release
Spread your legs downtown, as Im goin out to eat
Even hear the raw sounds when that raw got me in sleep 
Ima roll on em fore I ever let em roll on me
Split this one down the middle, wake up in the harmony 
Worry, sick, Im sick of worryin 
Its just the world we in, Id rather bury them
Im talkin fake friends and skeletons 
Early-mornin shoulder rubs, the lawyer sounding celebrant 
Im never settlin, this shit get darker than my melanin 
At the crib all by myself, this shit be cavin in
Scrollin through my call log, by emojis, how Im savin em
Them heart eyes, that peach one, my old ones, but I favorite them
That butterfly emoji hold me down and all my babies them 
Purple demon face one push away, he got the K on him
I broke bread instead of watchin niggas break down 
And saved a couple bitches too like Im from Cape Town
Know their position, you know ass up with the face down 
Im never content, two mil a event, I get it frequent
Im make an expense, to me, its just cents
Im droppin the top, not to feel the wind
Im droppin the top cause bro tryna spin
She droppin her top, she back again
Publicly she at the crib again, company 
I let it slide when I really shoulda slid 
After all the shit I did
Look at how they repayin me back 
Now follow my lead
Tell me what type of payment is that? , I put that on my kid
And my trust, yeah, it is what it is 
Im outside , twenty-nine, G5 , seaside
Ive been losin friends and findin peace 
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me

Up on a mountain 
Search through the valley 
You hear me calling 
Wont you come find me? 
Please dont forsake me 
All of a sudden 
My heart is breaking 

Mmmm, ay-oh
Hey...

Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin lit, feelin right, 2 AM, summer night
I dont care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, Im doing my thing
Rolling the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, Im screaming out Fuck that
Ima do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets
Im on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine aint always gonna be gold, hey
Ill be fine once I get it

Tell me what you know about dreamin, dreamin?
You dont really know about nothin, nothin
Tell me what you know about the night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You dont really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow
Im on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine aint always gonna be gold, hey
Ill be fine once I get it
Ill be good
Im on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine aint always gonna be gold, hey

You dont know me, nigga, I done changed 
So dont be trying to be putting on shit off in the game 
This aint no motherfucking 91
We out here rapping for money, you niggas rapping for fun
I dont fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
You would think its all mine the way I took it 
You would think it broke down the way I push it 
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldnt? 
Working, working, working, working, aint ya?

You just tryna be somebody
Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I wont have affairs, Im yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
You hit me like I know you’re there with someone else 
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio, so get undressed
Lets do the things that we say on text 
I want to get straight to the climax 
Yeah, have you coming all summer like a season pass 
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back 
Cause you talk like you got what I need 
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze 
Talk like you bet it all on me 
And you cant take no Ls off me

Ahem!
I tell her, Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
Im in Hells Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale Im weighin sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, Im danglin my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters cant see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I aint jump yet
But Im Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, Baby, its real.
And I say, I aint doubt you for a second.
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she wont, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin game right now
She will, yeah

She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will 
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin game right now
She will
Yeah
I tell her, Now go and pop that pussy for me!
Haters cant see me, but them bitches still lookin for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
Im all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry—call that whine n dine
Try to check me and Ima have em checkin pulses
They say, Choose wisely, thats why I was chosen
Rockin like asphalt, its the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But Im Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, Baby, its real.
And I say, I aint doubt you for a second.
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she wont
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will

Todos estan pendiente a ti 
Pero tu puesta pa mi 
Haciendo que me odien mas 
Porque todos te quieren probar 
Lo que no saben es que no te dejas llevar de cualquiera
Y todos te quieren probar 
Lo que no saben es que hoy yo te voy a buscar 
Dile que tu eres mia, mia
Tu sabe que eres mia, mia
Tu misma lo decias
Cuando yo te lo hacia 
Dile que tu eres mia, mia
Tu sabe que eres mia, mia
Tu misma lo decias
Cuando yo te lo hacia
Bebe, yo soy fan de tu caminar 
Te doy todo lo mio, hasta mi respirar 
Contigo veo todo como en espiral 
Quiero tirarnos fotos y que se hagan viral 
Tus ojos me concentran como Adderall 
Contigo me sube el overall 
Te toco y hasta el mundo deja de girar 
A nosotros ni la muerte nos va a separar 
Bebe, yo soy tuyo na mas 
Diles que conmigo te vas 
Que dejen de tirarte 
Que a ti nadie va a tocarte
Dile que tu eres mia, mia
Tu sabe que eres mia, mia
Tu misma lo decias 
Cuando yo te lo hacia 
Dile que tu eres mia, mia
Tu sabe que eres mia, mia
Tu misma lo decias 
Cuando yo te lo hacia 
Yo soy tu Romeo, pero no Santo 
A estos bobos con la forty los espanto 
Muchas me quieren desde que yo canto 
Pero yo soy tuyo na mas 
Yo soy tu Romeo, pero no Santo 
A estos bobos con la forty los espanto
Muchas me quieren desde que yo canto 
Pero yo soy tuyo na mas 
Dile que tu eres mia desde la high 
El yerno favorito de tu mai 
El capo que tenia to las Jordans y las Nike 
Dile a estos bobos que dejen de darte like 
Quiero esta noche entera
Pa recordar los tiempos en la escalera 
Dile que yo no soy cualquiera
Yo soy tu primero, tu eres mi primera 
Porque todos te quieren probar 
Lo que no saben es que no te dejas llevar de cualquiera 
Y todos te quieren probar 
Lo que no saben es que hoy yo te voy a buscar 
Dile que tu eres mia, mia
Tu sabe que eres mia, mia
Tu misma lo decias 
Cuando yo te lo hacia 
Dile que tu eres mia, mia
Tu sabe que eres mia, mia
Tu misma lo decias 

Thats what they doin, Camron
They actin like these singers, man
I aint— I aint goin to the studio till I got a situation
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer
Who— Who gon be on the hook? Man, what is you doin?
Go in the studio with fuckin clips, clips, ammo!
Brand-new Beretta, cant wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, Where the check, though?
Yeah, I said it
Wouldnt dap you with the left, ho, shut the fuck up
Text from a centerfold, I aint reply, let her know I read it though
Voicemail say she ready though 
Niggas know Im credible, aint no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the Cedes Benz pedal
Doin ninety on the bridge, like, Nigga, you already know
And if you dont know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin up the angles
Now Im in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four, five chains, man, the gold gettin tangled
My nigga Biz said, The first mill gon change you
Change for the better, hit it, then dead her
Thats my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we aint even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we aint even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Aint a damn thing changed, you can still get the work, ayy
Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you
Yeah
I remember I had went to Louis V with Haf
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never, ever thought Id see that in my life
Now Im in the East cause them boys are gettin right, man
I was on TV, makin fifty racks a year
After helpin Mama out, the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I cant do this on my own
So I started askin them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah
They did put me on
Now we in the basement, and we workin on the phone
Now we in the basement, and we workin on the phone, man
Line blowin up, workin on the phones
Now we in the basement, and we workin on the phones
But I just couldnt do it, had to leave that shit alone, man
Hear what?
Yo hear what, take time
 Ahh, no shit
Yo hear what?
Wha gwan, fry skull
Him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van
You know Drizzy
Blowin up
Line blowin up, they need the whole thing
Blowin up
My niggas really need the whole thing, yeah, yeah
Blowin up
Line blowin up, they need the whole thing
Blowin up
My niggas really need the whole thing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy
I do better with the rider in my system
Ooh yeah, Im on deck, when you call me, Ill listen
I listen unless I been mixin, you know when Im mixin
You know when Im mixin
I smoke when I drink, its tradition
Like Zoe mama, I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like Im Nixon, Im mixin
I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didnt
I been had these visions of the life Im livin since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it
And now we blowin up
Line blowin up, they need the whole thing
Blowin up, yeah
My niggas really need the whole thing, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah
Yeah
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, lets get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and Im mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see em take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tryna decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder whats next for me
Longevity, wonder how long theyll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but cant change it alone
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
Thats quite a platform you chose, you shouldve kept it inside
Oh, you tried? Its so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girls age
It gets worse by the annual
My careers like a how-to manual, so I guess its understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin?
Im managed by my friends that I grew up with
Id rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadnt made it with this rappin
Wed prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women Im overtextin are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin with my image
Ive been tryna reach the youth so I can save em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
Bout how we need protection from those protectin the block
Nobody lookin out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it
And then they start to R.I.P. about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it—
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin out in public, thats a hotter subject
I been whippin Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, thats that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start its apparent
Im with a girl who ass is so big thats partly embarrassin
But fuck all the blushin and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, whats irkin you?
Shit is gettin so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that Im number one over all these niggas
Bein number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein us
Winter here already, but somehow Im heatin up
Been observin the game and felt like Ive seen enough
Lets drop a tape on these niggas, then well see wassup
Yeah, boy, you rappin like you seen it all
You rappin like the throne should be the three of yall
Best I Ever Had seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, wheres the love and the peace?
Why you rappin like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And Im never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody thats comin for me
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin like its just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin all loose ends, I be the barber for free
Im almost at four minutes goin off on the beat
Feel like Im in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah
And on top of that its getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said theyd have a problem marketing me
And now its everybody else thats getting hard to believe
But, man, oh, you gotta love it 
Yeah
And head to toe, Im Prada covered 
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, Im a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it
Yeah, gotta love it
Laughs

Heard all of the talkin, now its quiet, now its shush 
Twenty-nine is comin, they on edge when I cook 
Lead the league in scorin, man, but look at my assists 
Yes I be with Future but I like to reminisce 
I do not forget a thing, Im patient, its a gift 
Try to tell em they aint got to do it, they insist 
Yeah, I can tell
I just gave em two for forty million like Chappelle 
Standin over coffin with a hammer and a nail 
Heard you hit up so and so, that name dont ring a bell, nah
Sick of these niggas 
Hire some help, get rid of these niggas
Im sick of this shit 
Im runnin a blitz 
Whatever you did , it is what it is
And Im so tired 
I fuck with the mob and I got ties 
Knock you off to pay their tithes 
They want me gone but dont know why
Its too late for all that lovey-dovey shit
Im your brother shit, all that other shit

Yeah, you think I need you but I dont
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this aint a lil boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean
I dont usually do this less Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now, got me talking about my life
I dont usually do this less Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now
I dont usually do this less Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now and I need ya in my life
I dont usually do this less Im drunk or Im high

Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldnt be driving, it just got so much harder
Cant even see it straight, I cant even see it straight, ah
Fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot, but Im the truth, thats right, I fuckin said it
The living proof that you aint gotta die to get to heaven
You, girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
Howd I know? Howd I know? Thats me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you askin me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rap and bitches, bitches and rappin
Rappin and bitches until all of it switches, I swear
Its been two years since somebody asked me who I was
Im the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was
Thats whats important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing, Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, Im a uptown nigga, ah
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, Im gettin back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, Im an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause Im down to spend whatever, lately, Ive been on a roll
And I do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon tell me that she dont dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, thats all Im really good for
Memphis, Tennessee know, see, I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowin in they mouth
And they rockin furs like its snowin in the South
And every pretty girl tell me thats the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who Im tryna be like?
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realize that turnin papers in wont get me paid
And if I dont do nothing, Ima ball
Im countin all day like the clock on the wall, yeah, I need that
Making major changes to the life Im livin
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, Im gettin back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, Im an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause Im down to spend whatever, lately, Ive been on a roll
And I do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga

I am convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like, Brrp!
Im on that wave tonight, I hope you not the crazy type, yeah
Im in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight, yeah
PND aint with the ray-tay, you know Jay Wray
Got girls here, going way, way, way, way, way, way—
Sauga-city trip, the payday
Glod up off a Gateway, man, you cant afford me
Doing is one thing; doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in they feelings these days, all in they feelings these days
But hearing a scripture with that many 6s, you should be afraid
Young nigga, preach

Boy, you should know that
Your love is always on my mind
And I cant deny it

One of dem ones—right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldnt buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably wouldve got in less trouble just goin with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, theres a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin to show
Im lookin at they first week numbers like, What are those?
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and Im Eddie Murphy, we tradin places
Look in the mirror, Im closer than I really appear
Creepin like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but theres a risk in collecting
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldnt pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and its a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin
A lot of problems that cant be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like Im born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You dont be scorin perfect
You dont be workin like how we be workin
You platinum like wrappers
On Hersheys boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you aint heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
Its rainin money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
Im assumin everybodys 35 and under
Thats when I plan to retire, man, its already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldnt tell me you loved me, started seein Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is Im TBE
The best ever, dont ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin settled
Dont get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Dont let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Yall was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin on waste movements
You was ridin TTC metro, I had the place boomin
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin in that bitch like we already knew it
But money cant buy happiness, Jellee talkin truthful
But Im happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want

No, no, no
I been callin on, callin on you
No, no, no
Yeah
I been callin on, callin on you
Uh
Word on road is the clique about to blow
You aint gotta run and tell nobody, they already know
Weve been living on a high, theyve been talking on the low
But its cool, know you heard it all before
Thats why I asked you
How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah
Thats why I asked you, how you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah, heh, uh
How you mean? How you mean? What you know about the team?
Man, these niggas need to stop it, they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl, you need to stop it, all that pride and self-esteem
Got you angry about this girl Im with in all them magazines
Baby, she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Dont listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know, I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Trying to tell you Im the one, come and holla at me
Before Im on the next ting, YMCMB, ah
Ooh, finally got you right here 
Tonight, Ill ease your mind 
Thats why Im callin on you 
And, ooh, oh

Its hard to stay away 
You keep me callin on you 
How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah
How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah, heh
How you mean? How you mean? What you know about the team?
You just know what you get told, girl, I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gon have to get it cleaned
She been going way too hard, someone has to intervene
Baby, she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Dont listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know, I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Girl, they love me like Im Prince, like the new king with the crown
Bunch of Underground Kingz, thought you knew how we get down, huh?
Ooh, finally got you right here 
Tonight, Ill ease your mind 
Thats why Im callin on you 
And, ooh, oh
Soft, youre loves desire 
Its hard to stay away 
You keep me callin on you 
How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy
How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah
Ah, call on you
Just mail me my ring back
Oh, I wanna call on you, baby
Cant keep that shit
Oh, I wanna call on you, baby
She said I could call on you, baby 
Ayy
La, da, da, da, da, la, da, da, da, da, baby

Diplomatic immunity, fuck em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shitll ruin me, fuck em, yeah
Cause niggas started talkin to me like Im slowin down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all youll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wallys, waiter twistin the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin through the tension, of course
Girls huggin me then askin me, What scent that is, boy?
I be walkin around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school theres no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house the embassy
The studio the chapel, I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solana show, the girls a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest Ive been, thats word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isnt much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and Ill bury you where they wont find ya
Motor City Casino, Im at the cage with my old license
They tell me dont worry, I got your money like Osirus
Dirty 30, workin on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyns favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin preggo
Wakin up at 6 PM like, Where does the day go?
Forecastin tornadoes, brainstormin retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Surenos
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me its not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldnt
Niggas stakin out the crib, its all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas round tall ladies
I gotta watch who Im talkin to like its all-ages
Ive seen buddin careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least its expected
Tell em I dont wanna link like a broken necklace
Ill be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin Al Jazeera
InshaAllah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira
I love, I love
I love, I love it

Uh
Aw yeah, aw yeah
Call up on drank and lets
Lets call up and, uh
All I care about is money and the city that Im from
Ima sip until I feel it, Ima smoke it til its done
I dont really give a fuck and my excuse is that Im young
And Im only getting older, somebody shouldve told you
Im on one , fuck it, Im on one 
I said Im on one, fuck it, Im on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and Ima get that shit
Cause Im on one, fuck it, Im on one
Aw yeah, aw yeah
You know what Im
Oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yeah
Uh, oh yes, oh yeah

Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfuckin North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like its somebody you dont know
Tell me, how the fuck we posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you dont show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people dont like me no more
New shit dont excite me no more
Guess that they dont really make em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I aint myself
Cause if yall what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell em all
Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
Im all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh
Thats that shit that drives me crazy
And its all that Ive been getting lately
And its probably why Im scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like theyre me and Im them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find em in you, in you
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, woah, woah, woah

Still got love for you, mami

Even if you gotta leave somebody yeah
Yes Im hurting, yes Im jaded 
Most of these things I dont wanna say 
I wanna be around while you chasin 
You wanna hit me up when you make it
Youll try and come back when you famous
I always want the truth but its dangerous 
You got somethin real, not basic 
You wanna get with me, stop
Yes Im hurting, yes Im jaded 
Most of these things, I dont wanna say 
I wanna be around while you chasin
You wanna hit me up when you make it

I always want the truth but its dangerous 
You got somethin real, not basic
You wanna get with me, stop 
Yeah, dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
Ayy, told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your familys house, for what?
Said you need some time but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin rounds the same as being stuck
And like guns with the ink in, youre gettin under my skin
Pretty little young thing 
Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited
Yeah, you played me, you played me, you played me
Lowdown, dirty, shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin
Thats besides the point Im makin
Youre way too opinionated to have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in 
We coulda waited, I wasnt rushin, difference in ages
Youre old enough, but youre still a baby
Youve shared stories where you did amazin
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I musta changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin jaded 
Most of these things I dont wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin 
You wanna hit me up when you make it
Youll try and come back when you famous
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side

Yeah, more, yeah
More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
Its only me, but Im seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, Im forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin, I know that days comin
I put it all in the music
Because if I dont say it here, then I wont say nothin
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas thats hatin
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmatian
Cops snoop around now, cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my minds not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so its all dares
Count it, its all there, and we all square
Quick money, Im in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar til its thinnin out
But, shit, look at Dennis now, all Stacy Adams and linend out
More blessings for Sandi and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups on this shit when I cant see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feelings gone like them old pictures
Mixin liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I dont miss ya
And no matter what year it is, Im a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, its all lies and its all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a not guilty
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didnt live it
But still, they try and tell you Im not the realest
Like Im some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really its you with all the drug dealer stories
Thats gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you aint lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, This what we need to be on, but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And youll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Cant show us where the cash is, me, I dont judge
Im just going off what the math is, numbers inflated
They all look at me, like, What have you done for me lately?
I like your older shit but wasnt in love with the latest.
Aw, baby, stop debatin, Im just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know Im the greatest then give you tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xannd and perkd up
So when reality set in, you dont gotta face it
Im down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
Im like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy

See whatever I say goes, I play like Im on roids, no Canseco
No Oakland As though, shout out the Bay though
I think Im on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I could never hate though
Signin off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so-and-so, where did they go?
Too worried bout bitches and fashion, they go missin in action

Gotta learn to line em up and then attack
They gon say your name on them airwaves

Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin treasure map
And aint told no one where the fuck its at
Shout out to the Gs from the ends
We dont love no girls from the ends
Im gon hit em with the wham once again
Ima always end up as a man in the end, dog
Its just apparent every year
Only see the truth when Im staring in the mirror
Lookin at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I aint tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know Im the man with it, uh
With the bands like I mustve went to Clark, went to Hampton
I aint playin with it
I aint felt the pressure in a little while
Its gonna take some getting used to 
Floatin all through the city with the windows down
Puttin on like I used to 
They never told me when you get the crown
Its gon take some getting used to 
New friends all in their old feelings now
They dont love you like they used to, man
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin
Yall dont understand, Im the one they want to hear from
Yall dont understand that its me or nothin
Yeah, Im fuckin glowin up
Shaq postin up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldnt have hated that
Lets be real, nigga, you couldnt have made it that, woo!
Dance how I dance, watch me dance
Youre fuckin with the best, man, Im too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Cant meet the terms, keep it movin then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the woes Im home now
Ill tell em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy
I aint felt the pressure in a little while
Its gonna take some getting used to 
Floatin all through the city with the windows down
Puttin on like I used to 
They never told me when you get the crown
Its gon take some getting used to 
New friends all in their old feelings now
They dont love you like they used to, man
When you get to where the fuck Im at
You gotta remind em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I aint never spent
When they say youre too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind em about where Im from
Not about where Im going, about where Ive gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in 87
Lord, tell em bitches I aint got no times to play games with em
I aint got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
Im fuckin her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin thats B-roll, bitch
I aint felt the pressure in a little while
Its gonna take some getting used to 
Floatin all through the city with the windows down
Puttin on like I used to 
They never told me when you get the crown
Its gon take some getting used to 
New friends all in their old feelings now
They dont love you like they used to, man
Yeah, they dont love you like they used to 
In the city with the- windows down

Take some to getting used to 

And I know the sun will rise with me 
And I know the sun will rise with me 
And I know the sun will rise with me 
And I know the sun will rise with me 
Just Blaze 
Its your worst nightmare, its my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So Im going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I dont trust these hoes at all
But thats just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that Im ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
Thats why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bought em sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But its whatever if somebody wont make it a thing
Im more concerned with niggas thinkin bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields, they makin the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like Im working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin team
Matchin Rollies for real, matchin Rovers for real 
Places they say theyve been, we actually goin for real 
Im really killin shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin 
Im going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin for the right way to do the wrong things 
With my new bitch thats livin in Palm Springs
Young-ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if theyd ever survive in this era
In a time where its recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin fun at
Never the flow, though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
Im a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix
I havent figured it out cause my story is far from finished
Im hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin emotion dont ever mean Im a pussy
Know that I dont make music for niggas who dont get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, Im heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson, boost the rate up, its time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
Thats why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real
Huh
You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
Im going so hard, my nigga
I swear, homie
Every day is another opportunity to reach that goal
I fell in love with the pen, started fuckin the ink 
The hustles an art, I painted what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica 
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, Im talkin Carnival Cruise
And these niggas talkin like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
Its the red bottom boss , came to buy the bar 
Every bi-week, shit, Im bound to buy a car 
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double-R 
Headlights flickin, lookin like a falling star
Every day, them hammers bang, whippin yay like Anna Mae
I run the game, but the ladies think Im runnin game
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate

Yeah, Cash Money shit, Cash Money shit

Link up, Ill roll through the hood
Problems, but everythings all good, my love
Your nigga doesnt want smoke with me, nah, no way
Trust me, its all okay, trust me, its all
You just need some, someone thats calm and patient
Submission, domination
Arched back, deep stroke
White wine, weed smoke
Thats my best combination
You just need some dick with no complications
You just need some, you just need some
Late night attention, uncondition
All that youre missing, my babe
Fucked up, shouldnt even have to justify
I get it, Im on your side, guys get their way all the time
Besides, pleasure not meant for one side
You should just do whats best for your mind
How bout I just take my time?
You call up my line, I fall up inside you
Girls need love, too, I know
Girls need love, too 
Girls, girls need love, too 
Girls need love 
Girls need love 
Girls need love, too

Ayy, wild things youre doin at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin it all just to feel things
Drinkings enough of a vice
Drugs just arent suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing
You, you, you know
Thats not the way to get over me
I dont know what youre sayin
You, you, you know
Thats not the way to get over me
All of a sudden you say you dont want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door
It dont matter to me
It dont matter to me what you say
It dont matter to me
It dont matter to me what you say
I cant recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I cant jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
Youre actin out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin over somethin 
You, you, you, you, you know
Thats not the way to get over me
I dont know what youre sayin

All of a sudden you say you dont want me no more

Girl, your love, you think you broke it

Yeah, yeah
Envy is a sign of admiration
Hate: It’s the epitome of destruction
Tal parece que mi amor crece y crece, pero tu desvaneces
Y me ofreces tu amistad sin otra excepcion
Se que hay otro hombre que ha logrado lo que yo jamas a ti te di
Un hogar, una familia, un buen porvenir; perdon por hacerte dano
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque el te haga feliz
A mi nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que el gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdi
Celo sus besos sobre tu cuerpo
La envidia se apodera asi de mi y te quiero aqui
Odio ese hombre porque esta a tu lado
Perdi tu amor, soy un pobre diablo
Sin tu amor yo no soy nada, nada
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque el te haga feliz
A mi nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que el gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdi
Escucha las palabras
Yeah, drizzy Drake
Yo fui el llanto, el es tu sonrisa 
Y lo nuestro desplomo sobre un volcan muy de prisa
Uh, you were the one
Youve been the one from the moment I seen you
Sometimes I question if this is all real
Then I grab on that ass and I firmly believe it
And you look like you drawn by an artist
No you, you look like Bernice and Yaris
But both put together, those are some girls that I know from back home
If you saw em youd get it
Look dont worry about it, keep speakin Spanish
Ill get it translated, you know you my baby
Anything for you, anything baby
I do not wanna be enemies baby
I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house, so I live with you baby
Dont stay with this new guy, I really go crazy
I really go crazy
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio, aunque el te haga feliz
A mi nada me intimida, pero entiendo
Que el gano la guerra hace tiempo

All you self-promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fuckin game thankless
We movin militant but somehow you the one tankin
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris bottle sender, check picker-upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble
I guess its different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OGs tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha
No way out cause Im already in it
Im not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since No Scrubs and No Pigeons
Even back when I wasnt as poppin
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road
And I told em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike
Those my dads words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Cant nobody hold me down
Especially not right now
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that
No love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that
Damn, nigga, what is that?
Yall dont hear no songs
They hit my phone like, You did that
They even hit my line like, Where you been at?

Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She aint sorry and I aint sorry, its too late for sorry
Green, white, and red on my body cause Im dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Rose and calamari
Look, now you got me started
Im the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose cause in every situation Im the bigger artist
Always gotta play it smarter
Yall shook up, Im here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
Thats why I gotta duck behind Chubbs shoulder just to hit the kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?
Chubbs, why try? Im a thug, Ima die high
Got the rose pink tinted lenses, its a Wednesday

Man, you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You dont know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
Its all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, youve been on my mind lately
Youve still got my number, girl, you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I cant trust no fuckin body
They still out to get me cause they never got me
They still out to get me, they dont get it
I cannot be got, and thats a given
They like, Pablo—
Why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?
Why do you know every single bitch that I know?
Why cant you just shut your mouth and take the high road?
Fuck if I know, thats that Chicago
South, south side, thats the motto
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, ayy
Throne is back up in it, ayy
In the field like Emmitt, ayy, yall get so offended, ayy
I be blacking out, I aint backing out
Jay about his business, and Ima let you finish, but I
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki 
Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich 
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit 
All my niggas wanna do is pop style 

Man dont live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay
Yeah
I pull up in Lexus like its 07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin
Boss up, Im the bigger homie
But Im one year older than my lil homie
09 they was biddin on me
But Im Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin
Chasin women a distraction
They wan be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Dont you see RiRi right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Dont get along man, we tried it
Whats the point in even tryin?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffanys
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I dont let it get to me
Done
Look what Ive done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, Im just dunning the hype
Me, Im just dunning the hype
Me Im just done, done, done, done, done
I dont take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin 1s out the plastic
Her gram too poppin to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, Im serious
I feed my family with this
So dont play with my money this summer, Im serious
I dont run out of material
You shouldnt speak on me, period
You try to give em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasnt hearin it
They feeling a way and wont hide it
Niggas done being silent
Dont get along man, we tried it
Whats the point of even tryin?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give em no empathy
Ima have Bs when Im 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I dont know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I dont let it get to me
Done
Look what Ive done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, Im just dunning the hype
Me, Im just dunning the hype

Yeah
Never thought Id be talkin from this perspective
But Im not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
Cause I just checked my phone and I didnt get it
I mean, Ill say hats off for a solid effort
But we didnt flinch for a second, we got our shit together 
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
Im talkin bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin lives, got me scared of losin mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flyin over Chattanooga, out here tryna spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google, yeah
Back in the city, shit is gettin brutal
These kidsll hit your noodle, then take a girl to the movies
They been droppin out on both sides
We aint in it, we just ghostride
The pen is workin if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just makin moves on your own time
But just know itll be January in no time
And your absence is very concernin
Its like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready case we need to retire your jersey, yeah
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championship celebrations durin regular season
Paternity testin for women that I never slept with
Im legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like Im Michael Jackson
Luckily, Im great at avoidin distraction
Used to give no reaction, now Im overreacting
Aw, nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer to My Dreams
Wide-eyed and uneducated at nineteen
I cant rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all the shit I seen and the things I believe
Drastically changin, thank you for all your patience
Im just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
Four thousand square feet just isnt as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
Im tired of awkward exchanges and niggas crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
The season start and I dont wanna see you end up with nothin
Yall throw the word family around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I wouldve never thought this was comin
They knees give out and they passin to you all of the sudden
Now you the one gettin buckets
They put they arm around you, now you becomin the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you
Or convince you that they care and see where it goes from there, but
These aint the girls from Brampton, this aint that local action
The hate is just bringin me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie, then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep the shit to ourself
Papi champu, young Pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I
Was destined for this shit when I was round Keyshia Cole and T.I.
And Young Dro was poppin off with Aint I
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doin macarena
But, who am I to complain now? Im still around, they know

Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Summers mine
I swear I said it about a hundred times, Ima need it back
Wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I havent changed, girl, I needed that from you
Im gettin money just taking care of me, girl
Im spendin time just taking care of me right now
Im gettin money just taking care of me, girl
Cause youd be tired of taking care of me by now
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh
But the good ones go
The good ones go if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long
But dont you go getting married
Dont you go get engaged
I know youre getting older
Dont have no time to waste
I shouldnt be much longer
But you shouldnt have to wait
Cant lose you, cant help it
Im so sorry, Im so selfish
Uh, uh, Ive been chillin in the city where the moneys thrown high and the girls get down
In case you started to wonder why my new shits sounding so H-Town
But when its all done, baby, Im yours if youre still around
She knows, she knows, she knows
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh
But the good ones go
The good ones go if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go if you wait too long
So you should go

I just wanna thank God
For all the pretty women he let into my life
All the Benjamins you let me count
Wealth and health
For my family
And lettin me ball on these niggas 
Ah

Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that Im forgiven for carin bout how they livin
And loanin a little money and keepin em out of prison
I aint lyin in my verses Im just telling you the basics
Of growin up with your friends and becomin the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin like our collars up
And good aint good enough, and your hood aint hood enough
Spent my whole life puttin on, you spend your whole life puttin up
Aint no telling when I go, so there aint shit that Ima wait for
Im the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for
Now theres a lot of bad bitches in the building 
A couple real niggas in the building 
Im finna kill niggas in the building 
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church 
We make it light up like a church

Lord forgive me for my sins, Im just tryna win
And she a devil in a dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I have her wet by 12 o clock, then 3 o clock she wet again
Im screaming Oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good

You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, Im wonderin what type of shit you wantin
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Dont be ashamed, it aint no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
Its only fittin cause Im lookin super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin to me
Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin to me
So I threw em back, now all my niggas hollerin, “Who was that?”
“Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you bout to do with that?”
Im finna take you home, just sip a little Patron
Now we zonin, baby you so fine
And can I hit it in the mornin?
Can I hit it in the mornin?
And can I hit it in the mornin?
The Sun risin while you moanin
And can I hit it in the mornin?
Can I hit it in the mornin?
And can I hit it in the mornin?
The Sun risin while you moanin
Uh, baby, you wintertime cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
Im tryna make the goosebumps on your inner thigh show
Ill let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work
Ill be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women cause my aunt she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
Im jokin, I mean that thing is pokin
I mean you kinda like that girl thats in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provokin
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I could do with lotion
Dont need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, when lights comin through the drapes and we both yawnin
I roll over and ask if I can hit it in the mornin
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin?
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin?
Yeah, the Sun risin while you moanin, baby
Can I hit it in the mornin, uh?
Can I hit it in the mornin, yeah?
Can I hit it in the mornin?
The Sun risin while you moanin
Hey, God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the woman that can hold Patron
God bless her homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you was clear
Im learnin not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear
Therefore you shouldnt judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here?
Just say youre scared if youre scared
But if you through frontin, we can do somethin
And you know just what Im talkin about
Tomorrow youll be callin out
Cause tonight we gettin right into the wee morn
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way, you think about me all day
Thats just a warnin
And can I hit it in the mornin?
Can I hit it in the mornin?
Can I hit it in the mornin?
The Sun risin while you moanin
Can I hit it in the mornin?
Can I hit it in the mornin?
And can I hit it in the mornin?

I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, itll make the shit last
Dont make it too easy, girl, dont take it too fast
Yeah, thats it right there, thats it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale, but you probably went to Howard, knowing you
Weekend in Miami, tryna study by the pool
Couple things due, but you always get it done
Mightve been a time where I loved her too
But you take that away and youve always been the one, one
I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe its just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in they life as a wife
Thats why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protest
Why you wanna fight for your right
Cause you dont love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Cant you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wonderin whats on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
Its just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so proud of you
Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so proud of you
Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so proud of you
Everythings adding up, youve been through hell and back
Thats why youre bad as fuck and you—
B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches Im badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when Im straddling
And my shits so wet, you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row your boat
Its Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, Im the realest still
The best legal team, so the deals is ill
Its MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too
Apparel, Im dominatin every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause Im fl-fl-fly, Im flyin high
Aint got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
Ill give it all away, dont care what the people say
Could be a million, billion, trillion miles away
He asked my sign, I said a Sag
Im a star, sheriff badge
Whats the point if Im guardin?
Double-D up, hoes, Dolly Parton
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Cant you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering whats on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
Its just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so proud of you
Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so proud of you
Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so proud of you
Everythings adding up, youve been through hell and back
Thats why youre bad as fuck and you know you are
And all I can say is
Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so proud of you
And all I can say is
Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so—
Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so proud of you
Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so proud of you
Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so, Im so proud of you
Everythings adding up, youve been through hell and back

I dont care what society thinks. Theyre nothing anyway. Theyre no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebodys already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. 
No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin
Not when everybody out here beefin
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
Americas most wanted, man, Im still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but Ill still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin
My competition, its beyond offensive
Im in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, Im tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, Im on a different mission
This the remix to Ignition, hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when its over with
I need to start sayin shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
Im just takin what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, well see where it gets me
I know catchin flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin efforts
And never placin second
And even better knowin youre first but then takin second
Inspirin and never takin credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Winnin is problematic
People like you more when you workin towards somethin
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others?
Only child that’s takin care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, its hard to believe it even for me
But youre mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin me at all
To wantin to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin
Im overcome with emotions
Ones I cant access when Im stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin
And icy Heineken drinkin, and rival neighborhoods linkin
And puttin your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin, picture postin
Claimin that youd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin
I notice people standin for nothin and gettin tired
I know what were both thinkin even when youre quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didnt lose you
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
This is the 6’s year
Six hundreds instead of six, OVO

We got 1942, Casamigos, its getting heated

But I know you wanna roll with the gang
And I know you want the finest of things

Rider shit
Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Aint been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, I heard you back with you know who
I told her, girl, Im always back with you know who, yeah
And she like, Who are we kidding? Youre 27, youre just being you
Youre your fathers child, man, thank God you got some me in you
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least Im always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolvin
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that theres someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me shes free Thursday
And Im sure that shes an angel, but she dont want this life
The timing aint right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But Im not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobodys confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I dont pretend with this, momma
Ion joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, momma
Im Game of Thrones with it, momma
Im Home Alone with it, momma
Im t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate gettin aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
Its just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - Im the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I cant be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me, momma
What more they want from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
Dont ever take advice, that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life
Yeah!
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesnt accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how were living
Im content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what its like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Lets just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit couldve gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now Im here and Im not black enough

Box
I would surely break the lock
Id jump right in and, and fall asleep, I, I fall asleep
Cause, cause, cause you, cause you are the death of me
Cause you are the—
If you was in a pine box, box
I would surely break the lock
Id jump right in and, and fall asleep, I, I fall asleep
Cause, cause, cause you, cause you are the death of me
Cause you are the—
The, the death of me, you, you, the death of me
Lookin in the mirror, Im embarrassed
Im feelin like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
Im in the matter of man, arm wrestlin hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it, I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction thatd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar
Women love when youre my type
And youre winnin from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein read
Ima go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat, capitalize that
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin device on your used 5 Series
I dont call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say we in the area cruisin in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you cant see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin
Then he said that he was the same age as
Myself, and it didnt help cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why Im breathin all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend say she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight was when he said
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy

Sippin on the drank, sippin on the drank 
Sippin on the drank, sippin on the drank 
All about the mula, all about the mula

Im steady droppin bombs on your head top 
Been that way since I could make your bed rock 
Im on Bloor where you cant shop 
Bitch, I just rapped and it went pop

Your next move cant erase your past moves
Took her out once she got attached to him
Ring, ring, click, Ill get back to em

Oh yeah, thats right—Im doing me, Im doing me
Im living life right now, man
And this what Ima do til its over, til its over
But its far from over
Uh, one thing bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, its just game
Its just what comes with the fame, and Im ready for that, Im just saying
But I really cant complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But Ill probably still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking Ima quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
Im really too young to be feeling this old
Its about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man, nobodys ever done it like I did it, uh

Fat boy, rich nigga, with a appetite
Count money all night under the candlelight
Spinnin vinyl, Teddy P, or is it Lionel?
Not a model, but I know I been your idol
Big bank, sparkin weed without a lighter
On fire cause Im just a different writer
Practicin social distance with all these snitch niggas
Guess he jealous cause I had his favorite bitch with us
Big bucks, steppin outta big trucks

Signed, sealed, delivered, I fucked the notary public
She witnessed me sign off on some undeniable numbers

Real life, the whole fam goons like Ralo
One truck in front of me, one behind me to follow
Lemme get a lemon pepper order, please
You gotta have the link before you order these
Dockin jet skis in the Florida Keys
We all grateful for Weezy, but no one more than me
You just found a bottle with the messages
These days, fame is disconnected from excellence
Half the time, I gotta ask niggas what they profession is
Ushered a generation in, these are where my confessions live
I did brunch with the judge we appearin before
Private villas only, I dont go near a resort
We want everything galore, not just Lira Galore
For real, and my city love me like DeMar DeRozan
I sent her the child support, she sent me the heart emoji
They all say they love me, but they hardly know me
Yeah, dropped him off at school, big day for my lil man
Recess hits, daddy prolly made another M
School bell rings and Im out there to get him again
Yeah, teacher-parent meetings, wives get googly-eyed
Regardless of what they husbands do to provide
Askin if I know Beyonce and Nicki Minaj
Of course, pull up to the front in the fleet of Suburbans
Flooded French Immersion with the Secret Service
Shit is so obvious, it defeats the purpose
If this is your hobby, then come and meet your maker

Lemme know if thats a problem 
If you got a problem with me, gotta walk around it
Used to say I had fore I got it, now I got it all
And bein honest, I dont really wanna talk about it
And if I didnt have it, wouldnt wanna sulk about it
I had it so long, I dont even celebrate it
Negative thoughts dont even enter my inner matrix
Magine me still rappin bout if I never made it
Damn, not too many parallels left in our lives
I mean, my crib look bigger through my sons eyes
And the squad look bigger to the young guys
And my dick feel better when you drunk, right?
Spend nighttime starin at the sunrise
And my diamonds all hittin like tie-dye
Air Canada Centre nigga when I die
Yall gon have to fly in and do your fake cry
First couple rows, you gon see the real guys
The ones that purchase they vehicles cause their trunk size
The ones that look at other rappers like its lunch time
Watch on my wrist never showed me crunch time
Cause I aint never let it come to that one time
To be real, man, I never did one crime
But none of my brothers could caption that line
At all, kill me, thats talent God wasted
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
When mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
Now its a movie, Im back at Bellag, wasted
Niggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin
Big body frames, wasnt into car racin
Me and Chubbs drive by, shorty heart racin

Livin in the 6, eight weeks, sun blazin
After that, the killers just go into hibernation
Damn, rest in peace Dolla Bill
How I get a girl and girls still wanna holla still?
How Im so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?
Everybody that survive got survivors guilt
My label gotta prove they love me, gotta wire mills
My boy kitchens done, lookin like a flour mill
You niggas faces lookin like you drink sour milk
And your albums like some mothafuckin fire drills
Its like this shit feels real, but its never real 
I been tryin, tryin, tryin, tryin
To get you under my pressure
I been tryin, tryin, tryin, tryin

Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
Thats why I pick and choose, I dont get shit confused

I hate when, I hate when people say they feel me, man
I hate that shit
Itll be a long time before yall feel me
If ever
For real
You wont feel me til everybody say they love you, but its not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fuckin hates you and your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend ass keep gettin thicker than the plot does
And when you forget her, thats when she pop up
And you got a drop, but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit right up your alley
Yeah, you see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
Its feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Stead of gettin a pat-down, they just keep on sayin that they feel you, nigga, yeah
Its been too long
Been way too long
Ive been faded too long, ooh
Ive been faded too long, ooh
Ive been faded too long, ooh
Why wont it stop? The ride
Why wont it stop? Ooh, the ride
You wont feel me til you want it so bad, you tell yourself youre in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mothers debit card so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that aint tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, thats just a way of life
Apartment 1503, some couches and paintings
Where you record with two others that want the same things
Yeah, it start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you gettin close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Tellin stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on tellin you they feel you, nigga
Yeah
Its been too long, man
Ive been faded too long, ooh
Ive been faded too long, ooh
Ive been faded too long, ooh
Why wont it stop? , the ride
Why wont it stop? , ooh, the ride
I havent been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long
Im drivin right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold, especially after summers rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, its got you asking whats good at home?
Whats good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shouldve known
My young niggas poppin Ms and sippin dirty Jones
Problem children that all be reppin Octobers Own
Brand new girl and she still growin
Brand new titties, stitches still showin
Yeah, and she just prayin that it heals good
Im bout to fuck and Im just prayin that it feels good
I really dont know much, but, shit, I know a secret
They say more money, more problems, my nigga, dont believe it
I mean, sure, theres some bills and taxes Im still evadin
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazin
Young money-maker, season-ticket holder
Season switching over

The cash blue, but Im still seein green
Im in the bathroom, and Im peein lean
My bitch a vacuum
I told her, Keep me clean, the scene serene
Im a badonkadonk and bikini fiend
I just need a queen that aint scared to fuck a Stephen King
I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee
And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street
How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen?
Dont ask me, but never change the channel
Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals
Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake
Propaganda bout to blow out the candle
My lil ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta
With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta

My bitch dance better than P. Diddys
And ever since the pandemic
They dont wanna let Drake out of Canada
I been screamin, Free Drizzy
I know bae trust my vision but dont want me to see prison
Said, I cant make no promises, either leave or come visit
But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit
Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women
But Im the greediest shark amongst an ocean of killers
I put you six feet deep, Im bein socially distant
Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress
Extra shots, extra clips, aint talkin videos nor vixens
Just come and see about it, bitch
Tunechi
Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in
I am the standout, you just my stand-in
These bitches copy my homework, thats what they hand in
Thats why Im private like the airports I land in
Life is a beach house, dont let the sand in
I ball in any arena, go let the fans in
I should go cop a new jersey, thats word to Camden
These bitches time tick-tockin, better stick to dancin
I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic
Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear can frolic
One Margherita pizza with Parmesan and garlic
These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics
Aint gotta ever talk about it when you are about it
Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it
Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent
Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Haagen-Dazsin
He call me solid even though Im drippin, water diet
Big booty stickin out, my Daisy Dukesll cause a riot
These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it?

No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me
Its corporate giants and machines that went against me
I wash bitches, man, they couldnt even rinse me
She said she hot, I said, Well, bitch, come and convince me
Aint no C in green, but Im seein green
Even with them floor seats, they couldnt see the team
The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen
I send shots, send em back or flee the scene
You know, one of the perils of makin money is
You can afford to be dramatic

Seen more plaques than toothbrushes
Until Im at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin, do somethin
All meetings happen in person, so they cant prove nothin
Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband
Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but whos rushin, whos bluffin? For real
Who you huggin, who you wanna be lovin?
I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, whos subbin?
El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league
Fuck with me, you niggas cant trouble me from the Doubletree
Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up

Face who? I could see a wall of yall, all of yall and run straight through
Trust, its all fun and games until I wanna play too
Ayy, dios mio, the ice is frio on the Jesus, its bringin me closer to God
Im already close to the mob, Im already known as the G.O.A.T
Could try and get close, but you wont, I already packed the garage
None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shits a facade
None of this shits a mirage
Thought I was seein things when I was seein green

Yeah 
Yeah

More Life flex, you dun know

Ha, yeah
They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?
They said, Fucking right, they were the first to go
Its nothing personal
Its just that all them women that you slept on been working though
Theyve been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With I swear, you dont know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But youre out here doing your thing, they dont know you
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
Its crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like, Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?
Well, out there there aint nothing for me and I think I need to come home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think Im so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all
I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, thats never fun
They say its on when they see me, that day dont ever come
Im never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me its all good, even when it feel strange
Now Im that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
Howd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
Howd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now Im living a muhfucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, thats all Ive been dying to hear
Lights get low and thats when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, thats why I gotta come home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think Im so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all
My mother is back to who she was years ago
Its like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish shed stop checking up on women I cant stand
Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks Ive become a slave to the wealth
But Id never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say What up, though?
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now Im feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe thats all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin love
Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And thisll be the year that I wont even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But Im just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised theyd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit, I swear its sounding like home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think Im so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all
Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?
But, it’s not copy do it, it’s the feel, you know? It carry a feel
Well, you ask plenty musicians — them know it, but them cant do it

Uh, Ive been up for four days, gettin money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin, how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me: Nobodys workin as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off, man, its probably true
Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin
Im just here makin all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin grown man liars
Storytellers, they aint even need a campfire
Uh, but I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin hard in his yellow goose - yeah!
And Im a motherfuckin missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Cant be
They must be talkin to themselves, Hov: hands free
Yeah, and Im just fillin up this daily planner
Gettin busy cause Im a star: no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer
Yeah, thats what life becomes when youre doin you
Welcome to Hollywood, dont let this town ruin you
And if you pillow-talkin with the women that are screwin you
Just know that she gon tell another nigga
When she through with you
Dont get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me
Who wouldve thought Id be caught in this life?
Lets celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down Ima make it go
Oww, hoes turn they heads like owls
Im the man of the hour
Triple entendre, dont even ask me how
Con Edison flow, Im connected to a higher power
Bright lightsll make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb when Im in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight cause the satellite was crispy, uhh
Yall can miss me with the money talk
The smart moneys on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk, uhh
I dont do too much bloggin
I just run the town, I dont do too much joggin
Mm, I aint got a scar yet
Cause you fuckin around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, heres how they gon come at you
With silly rap feuds, tryin to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors, uhh
I done seen it all, done it all
Thats why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summers ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, thats what winners do
And to these niggas Im like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
Im not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldnt change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas! Bitches, too!
All I got is this money — thisll do
Who wouldve thought Id be caught in this life?
Lets celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon make this bitch light up

P. Reign! Reps Up!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
Im not lookin at the phone, too much shit been goin on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk
Girl, we should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk
Life is great when you’re naked
You press the gas, and I brake it
I drink liquor, don’t chase it
And I get women, don’t chase ‘em
I put her face in the pillow
And watch her bite on the blanket
See you tempted to taste it
Get every drop and don’t waste it
I’m fucking with you, I’m fucking with you
The type of dick to make a white girl say, ‘’I love that nigga’’
I hit your Instagram and click Like on, like, every picture
You get it from your momma?
Well, then, bring your momma with you—
And lots of liquor
Tell he, fuck me like you hate me
You love me? I said, maybe
She said, Boy dont keep me waiting
I say, go down, dont be lazy, yeah
Now, thats my baby, thats my baby
She love me for my drive
I love her cause she drive me crazy—whats up?
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress, tryna put my mind at ease
Im not lookin at the phone, too much shit been goin on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl

Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck
Drunk and fuck, drunk
Girl, we should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck

OVO, I ride; OMO, I ride
Reps-Up, them my niggas from the Scarborough side
Don’t fuck with them, or hollow tips will fly
I don’t have to lie
Lot of people say it in a song just to say it
Man, I’m not that type of guy; hit me on the cell
I just might bring you to the city
Send you home with stories you can never tell
I’m tryna break you out of your shell
 You just turned 21 like Adele
That’s good with me; I put my business on hold
Let me turn off the phone, let’s explore the unknown
If you not drinking with me, you force me to turn up alone
No peer pressure, I just know you like to get in your zone
You say that you’d rather smoke
Well, let me call up OB’s room and tell him, Roll up a cone
I know he probably got that extra special 
I never second-guess it
Hows Villanova? What classes you taking next semester?
Man, she like, Fuck the small talk
I’m not here to discuss extra credits or my professors
No time for funny stories
It’s funny how she shows up late, but always comes before me
We both young and misguided, but that’s another story, yeah
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
Im not lookin at the phone, too much shit been goin on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck
Drunk and fuck, drunk
Girl, we should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck

Too rich for who? Yall just got rich again
Who grips the mic and likes to kill they friends?
Ive never been the type to make amends
If shit was at a eight, we like to, we like to, we like to—
Yeah, if shit was at a eight, we like to make it ten
1da sent this in, Im goin up all the way
I dont like to talk when theres nothin else left to say 
Drizzy bout to drop, the game is in disarray
Id tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your sister is pressin play, your trainer is pressin play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey— 
I gotta breathe real deep when I catch an attitude
I got a whole nother level that I can tap into
Max said they only blessed when they attached to you
The only deadbeats is whatever beats I been rappin to 
And the product is still the best though
Its only good in my city because I said so
Just to fit the estate man, I had to Copperfield like presto
Voila, tada 
Never a matter of could I? or should I?
Kiss my son on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, Ive settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—
Miss makin em pay
Helipad from Will Smith crib straight to the stage
Three Forum shows but I played Staples today
The neighborhood is smokey, yall stay safe in this place 
Drizzy bout to drop, the game is in disarray
Id tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your niggas is pressin play, your nanny is pressin play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey— 
Had to go and hit reset, now we here
I been on top for three sets of three years
I cant be around the niggas you minglin with
I cant fly if I could sit on the wing of that shit 
I try to pay it less mind
They been keepin tabs on me like Im payin next time
I think I sense a little fear from the other side
White vans parked across the street, real subtle guys 
Yeah, never a matter of could I? or should I?
Kiss my mom on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, Ive settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—
Hahaha, I cant argue with you, no! You mad!
Look at you, you mad! You big mad! Haheheh

I dont get paid to argue with you
No! Who is you? You aint nobody!

Uh, you getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyle
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin 10 pounds preparin for summer
And you dont do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you my sweetheart
Ive always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a lil class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it together, uh

They tell me time is money, well, well spend it together
Im down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you dont even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it, I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners

Sold that already, got a whole new set of toys
Shit is so surreal, Drizzy Drake, you better enjoy it
Nothing else bigger than the OVO letterman boys
Cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides
Ollie got the first edition parked up roadside
The only sign of strugglin is coming from those guys
Im tryna just relay what I can see through my own eyes
And nothin tell the truth like the eyes will
Lived so much for others dont remember how I feel
Friends in high places and friends that are hostile
Still managed to moonwalk straight through a minefield
And then Ill come back to tell you how that feels
Built this house for us all, pain in my back still
You niggas gassed up, you couldnt pay the

Yeah, oh
Heavy day

The citys on fire and people are in denial
Charges being laid, but well see what they do at trial
Im calling this shit from now
Sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down
I havent been able to see family for a while
That shit is wearin me out
I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar til my niggas carried me out
And if moneys all I need in my grave, then bury me now
I know I tend to talk about how I got a fortune on me
But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
Man, I cant even R.I.P. and show my remorse to the homie
Know I carry the guilt of the citys misfortunes on me
I even got the cleanin staff plotting extortion on me
My parents divorce is on me
My therapists voice is making the choices for me
And I always censor myself cause no matter what, they reporting on me
The pressure is weighin on me
Career is going great, but now the rest of mes fading slowly
My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me
My chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly
My heart feel vacant and lonely, but still
Im makin the most of this shit and more
Every single move is like rolling dice on the board
Seen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys
Id rather see all of em get twenty-five from the Lord
And if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five
Well, this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more

 windows of opportunity, let me go through the doors
This the part where I dont ever say Pardon me anymore
This the part where Ima find a new part of me to explore
This the part where all my partners know what we in it for
This the part where we gon throw us a party after the war
And if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket
Well, this is the perfect time that I empty them shits for sure
You owe that shit to the boy, yeah
I love you, I love you, I love you
I need to make you see

Yeah, woo
Im just in the cut sittin sideways
Way that you lookin all the time
Time gets to tickin and it takes a toll
Told you I couldnt really draw the line
Line ringin, sayin that you told him things
Things that you couldve kept inside
Sidetrackin me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind
I know you like to drink til the sun up
Grind til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they dont really miss ya
Rule number one, to be a boss-ass bitch 
Never let a clown nigga try to play you 
If he play you, then rule number two 
Is fuck his best friends and make em yes men 
And— 
Im just in the cut sittin sideways
Way that you lookin all the time
Time, it done left you with a broken heart
Hardly excuses how you play with mine
Mindin my business and you show up
Up to no good, I shouldve seen the signs
Signin me up to do your dirty work
Workin to try and get you off my mind
I know you like to drink til the sun up
Grind til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they dont really miss ya

Long way down from the heights Im chasin
Just touched down, I was lights out in Vegas
Girls checkin in cause my lifestyle dangerous
Hard to tell people that Im all out of favors
Call me for songs or they call me for paper
Turnin off my phone for the night now, baby

I could send a team to come drill you
I got a billion or two and I know where the fuck you live
Niggas gotta chill with talking gangsta
You should just thank us, humble yourselves a little bit
This aint the same Shawn that you knew once
I dont shine shoes, uh, this aint what you want, no
All that back and forth on the internet
Nigga, we dont tennis that, yall gotta do something, yeah
Only thing we spect now is violence
Anything besides this, we playing violins, uh
Im public enemy
Niggas wanted to kill me and yall want me to be friendly
Niggas want sympathy after they wanted to end me
Be those closest to it be the very ones that envy

Ayy, elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate
Im in bed awake, thinkin howd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
Theres no way that this is real, man, it cant be
If you need me, you can call me, I stay busy makin money
You know what is on my mind, all I think about is hunnids
I stay busy workin on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin off, I dont know patience
I got a chance then my niggas got it too like its contagious
I see the future when I get wavy 
But I couldnt picture bein Champagne when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldnt picture changes
When I was with Ms. Creighton, that lady hates me
Couldnt picture wifin Braden when I was pumpin gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldnt gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin way harder than Satan
Hes playin favourites, it feels amazin 
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This a life bid we can never separate
Im in bed awake, thinkin howd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
Theres no way that this is real, man, it cant be
Yeah, I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me, I begin to write the thesis
Franny got the Aria setup like its a Freaknik
Vegas like Marineland, that big whale treatment
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin

Yeah 
Ayy
Look
I wish everyone could tell me exactly what they need from me
The first second they speak to me, Im not with all the secrecy
Secretly beefin me behind closed doors
But playin it peacefully for the streets to see
My nigga, have some decency
Dont move like a puto
Could at least keep it a buck like Antetokounmpo
I made north of the border like Vito Rizzuto
Throwin parties in Miami, they lovin us mucho
With the ho ratio, Im like David Caruso
Theres a mad shortage of people givin me kudos
I been doin this since T-Pain was pourin us Nuvo
You tell em I run the country, theyll say, True, though
Papi chulo, grippin culo
And I got the flows niggas steal like boot toes
You boys reachin new lows
Lettin me take the rap for that Casper the Ghost shit
While you findin all of the loopholes
You niggas move too cold
See the watch collection and assume I got time
Cause of the ruby rose two-tone
Or switch it to the one I call R.I.P. Nipsey
Cause I swear to God the bezel got sixty of them blue stones
Maybe Im gettin too stoned
Calacatta marble for my tombstone
Here lies a nigga that never lied in his new song
Or any of his old songs
They sing them shits like folk songs
Kumbaya, boom-ba-ye
Know the owl stay on me
Bad bitches tryna come through and lay on me
Tryna get the earl grey on me
But I aint really into talkin names
Only tee youre getting from me is one for the walk of shame
Heart is on my sleeve and my body is in the hall of fame
High fashion and my life is full of climaxes
And my wishes come true without blowin eyelashes
Up in Bron crib, fishbowl wineglasses
Thats how we passin time
Hundred thousand on the line
At the table prayin banker shows a natural nine
It never happens half the time
My losing nights are still a vibe
Thats the things I accept
You over there in denial, we not neck and neck
Its been a lot of years since we seen you comin correct
Man, fuck a Respectfully, I just want my respect
They tried to label me mean, I say what I mean
People that couldve stayed on the team
They played in-between
Clouds is hanging over you now, cause Im reigning supreme
Some of these niggas say what they mean, it aint what it seems
Had to pull my niggas out the mud like Im trainin Marines
You niggas hot to them little kids, you aint famous to me
Told you Im aimin straight for the head, not aiming to please
I could give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and tees
Have somebody put you on a Gildan, you play with my seed
Trust me, theres some shit you really gotta come see to believe
Thats why your people not believers, they all leavin ya
Thats why you buyin into the hype that the press feedin ya
You know the fourth level of jealousy is called media
Isnt that an ironic revelation?
Give that address to your driver, make it your destination
Stead of just a post out of desperation
This me reachin the deepest state of my meditation
While you over there tryna impress the nation
Minds runnin wild with the speculation
Why the fuck we peacemakin, doin the explanations
If we just gon be right back in that bitch without hesitation?
But let me digress on behalf of the association
Ill play it cool with you, then mark a nigga like Copenhagen
See, they gettin loose with the line like open cages
In the La Ferrari, my emotions racin, dancin out a condo, ocean bathin
Niggas textin Bro, but we are not of no close relation
I was down to give these niggas credit, but hold the payment
Somehow Im the greatest in the game, to my own amazement
The greatest in the world, theres no debatin
You boys bout to wheel me to defeat like we rollerbladin
Far as the Drake era, man, we in the golden ages
Look at the total wages
And look at the heroes fallin from grace in their older ages
If we talkin top three, then you been slidin to third like stolen bases
Toss around Rollies with frozen faces
They used to tell me back in the day, Boy, youre going places
Never understood where I could really take it

Im runnin, but cant run away
You say you changed
But you never change up
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But youre just the same as I ever knew

I just threw these pills in my cup, yeah, yeah 
Shawty just pulled up just to get fucked 
But I only want top, yeah, for sure 
And I know Im on top, but I want more 
Remember I used to sleep on the floor 
Now every day I rock Christian Dior

Yeah, I was about to— Man, I thought about it
Its unsettlin to talk about it
Free all of my niggas that they caught with it
RIP my niggas that they caught without it
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself
This is Gods plan, young man, you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt

Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil, Ill save that for the rain

Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin its childish, the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, Im out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brothers name
Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things
Certified lover man, trappin out the motherland
Always move right so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know whats in my pockets, they dont understand
My assistant always findin Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like its on demand
I decide what to be next like Im switchin plans
Ima tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, prayin hands like Im a religious man
But Im just a sicker man, wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but whos the richer man?
Isnt that what matters in this world that we livin in?
Bang those dividends, snakes stay slitherin
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin in?
How you plan to take a niggas spot by just givin in?
How you gon treat this shit like you gon get to live again?
How you gettin hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you mad at after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas thatll love you til the bitter end
Bet you got somebody thats just smarter than your other friends
Give em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others couldve been
There when others shouldve been
Got a nigga starin at the game like, Damn, coach, put him in
But you never listen, so you niggas goin wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin me to put it in
And its not because all of the money that you wouldnt spend
And its not because I set it up to try and get revenge
Its because you niggas insecure, you aint made men
Its because even though you hate on me, we stay friends
Its because you niggas never learn when to say when
Yeah

Can I have an honest moment wit you right now, baby?
Tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I get an honest answer from you right now, baby?
Cause all we ever talk about is me
Can I? Before I turn the lights out
Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be

Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
Can I see you right now, I know the sun is up, baby?
Sorry, I dont really have a choice
Can I ever make you feel like Im down for you, baby?
You do so much more than that for me

I want my baby to have your eyes
Im going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I cant decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I cant even lie, Id rather stay inside
I cant do suit and tie
Cant be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time, I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time, emotions running high
I wish you felt alright

All the time, all the time, all the—
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time

And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I cant put that shit aside
Ive been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
They be throwin in the towel
I do yellowtail at TAO

Especially when its to my face
Everything will be okay

Skid around ends with the bros and Im kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one

Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin low
I dont stop, man, Im stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen, we with everything
I went off in the 16, give me 17
Want a lot, cant have everything, cant have everything
Want a lot, cant have everything, but I want everything
Bad attitude, tellin who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down, whos callin my name?
Whos involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
Ill do a song now, man
Even though theres way less to prove to yall now, man
Everything that went around is comin back around
Yall better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, its all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin
Damn, I must be coachin, cause Im not playin with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin lights on in the buildin
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn
Cant have everything, cant have everything
Want a lot, cant have everything, but I want everything
Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin, always duckin my release dates
Thats when the phone starts ringin, like, Are we straight?
Two-faced niggas back around with the three-face, damn
Ol triple-double-Russ face, watch-with-the bust face
Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face
Never-met-myself, I-dont-remember-who-I-was face
Yall fuckin hilarious
Yall really think yall niggas teamin up is scarin us
Yall niggas is arrogant, yall sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin
Tell your big homie Im all for goin there again
He aint even die, and I ball with his inheritance
All thats in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, East side, all that for my area

Here we go
Yeah
Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that its not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like Billie Jean, but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time, and all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothin like the new times
Now its rough times, Im out here on front lines
Just tryin to make sure that I see him sometimes
Its breakin my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now Im embarrassed to tell em I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because Ive been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I dont want you worry bout whose house
You live at, or who loves you more or whos not there
Who did what to who fore you got here
Nah, look, Im too proud to let that come between me and you now
Realize I gotta think for two now
I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if Im not dead, then Im dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I cant forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin
Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rose and the Baccarats out
For our cheers to the next generation
But this Champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he mustve brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growin so fast that they dont even really fit
But man, you know
I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You havent met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably coulda did stand-up
Yeah, but at the same time, hes a stand up
And thats how you gon be when its time to man up
October baby for ironys sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now its yours
And believe me, I cant wait to get a hundred more
Sorry Im ventin, tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks, youre supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of always cuttin each other down
God willin, I got a good feelin
You got a good spirit
Well talk more when you hear this, my G
Im changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, Im all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, Im all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
Im all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man

Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh 
Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on makin the world feel some
They dont have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldnt even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take em to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of C-notes, get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandras rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like Im Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that, I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood to go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But its gon take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasnt made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin numbers like Im Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
Im the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Niggas want a classic, thats just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese, you dont want drama, capisc?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin and commas increase
Im standin at the top of where you niggas are climbin to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for mes askin what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin backwards
Like Charlamagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and Ill be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we cant afford again
Like I said, can of worms and Im the early bird
Niggas want to hang but Im too busy doin dirty work
Hit em back and say well link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin me, it aint dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I dont know whos protectin me but we hit it off
Sandras rose, no wonder they tryna pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

The only thing Im seein Id like to put an amend on, perhaps a little more room here for the fixins, you know what Im talkin about? Oh, we gon have a lot of fixins. We gonna have so many fuckin fixins up in this motherfucker, this shit gon go through the roof. Got damn Im shittin gold these days

Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it, ayy
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it
Yeah, she said she workin for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it makes sense why you work at the head office
In 2007, I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin and go off like Nigga we made it! 
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin 
I just came to make sure you not missin no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest
Bitches cant front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she dont know who I am, she just know that Im famous
Ima just hand her a business card and say Nigga we made it!
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon text her best friend like Girl he got some good dick and money
Her friend hit her back like I know that already, that niggas amazin
Then I send a message to both of they asses like Nigga we made it!
Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down. Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin the hell up and enjoyin the show
Ayy, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it, ayy
Nigga we made it, ayy

Yeah, if they with me, just know that they wit it and bout it
If I said it, I meant it, theres no way around it
OVO, Reps Up, and P. Reign is next up, watch Gway go crazy
When Baka came home for the holidays, I was like Nigga we made it!
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it 
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience 
My life for your life, man I wouldnt trade it
I would just look at you dead in yo face and say Nigga we made it!
I swear that we made it, selloff that ting, Im the king in Jamaica
But Ive been on that wave, thats why this year I tell ya, I dont need no favors 
And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it!
You dont know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin on tables, my karmas amazin
Im out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with
Thats ignorant, aint it? Sometimes I question myself when I think bout the pictures I painted
Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom like Nigga we made it!
Ayy, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
Damn, we made it
I remember standing in the hood
Tellin my partner, and my momma, everything gonna be all good
Nigga we made it! Damn, Im up in Las Vegas
Damn, I never was supposed to have shit, now my life is lavish
Every night, fuckin a bad bitch, nigga we made it!
Coppin a Lambo, cash, the Bentley, two times I crashed
Ha, nigga we made it!
Look at them niggas faces, them niggas, they hate it
I look a nigga in his face and say Nigga we made it!
Soulja Boy stunt on them haters
And these days I dont need no favors, ayy
Nigga we made it!
You already know man
Phone call back to the old hood, see whats goin on

Hello

I need someone that loves me
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to

You know, we dont have to be dramatic
Just romantic
Do all the little things, little things, little things
That excites me
As your woman
Give me a kiss goodnight
Over the phone
When youre working late
When youre out of town
Tell me how much you need this
Cause we deserve it
We can be together, but
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to 
You need me to 
You need me to
Hold one vibes
Pree more life

D. Hill 
Ayy
I shouldve put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment 
Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
Cause you got desires
You got that fire and Im not a liar
You had me down on my knees every day, had to talk with Messiah
Im in that 8 and that 1 and that 2, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin too close to the city, you actin too vulnerable livin this life
I shouldve moved you away from Houston before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, youre not actin like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second string
I shouldve put you somewhere where no one could find you 
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment 
Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
Cause you got desires
Ayy
Self-control has never been your thing
Dont think itll help if theres a ring with a rock in it
Where Im from, they serve the soda clean 
You come from a city where theres lean with the rocks in it
How the fuck you keep so many secrets?
How you goin vegan, but still beefin with me again?
How the fuck youve seen so many beaches?
Tickets to them places dont come cheap, and
I see you back in Turks
Remember who took you there first and dont you forget it
Got you a whip, but then you got back on your shit
I had to tell Eric go get it
Im always movin too fast, the feeling dont last
I feel like you take me for granted
Probably my fault for the way that I handle it
I shouldve put you somewhere where no one could find you 
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment 
Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
Cause you got desires
Ooh, shawty, you tried it
Voice gettin filled with entitlement
Why would you tell me those lies? And
Why would you make it so bold to my face?
Why are your stories all over the place?
Whole lotta secrets friends dont keep safe
Where did your friends all go? 
I cant solve your problems
You say your problems never needed solvin
I was too good to you, shouldve stayed solid
Nice guys always finish off where they started
Deja vu, you wanted things and you got em
Deja vu, I wanted smoke and I got it
Deja vu, deja
Deja
Alright, so unfortunately, Im still here 
But, you know, if youre here, its still up
In the building
And you just wanna hear some chune, some music
I think, you know, you found the right spot
Im outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
You know, shout out my brother Drake, for you know 

Look at my history
Im tryna see whats different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas thatll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, thats it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin me gon have my niggas testin machinery
They say that they happy, my man, thats not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin while other niggas is overreactin
Thats how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
Thats some insight for yall even if no ones askin
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot cause they told on me
Im bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
Im buyin the buildin of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
Im bankin two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin through
Keepin my connections strictly physical
Everyone thats married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I dont carry cash cause the money is digital
Its the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I dont know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends Im not the villain
Send em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin math, but Im better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin in a sport where we were gettin rings
I wouldnt have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that weve done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the namell echo
Years later, none greater

Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Ayy, yeah
Tay Keith, this too hard
Ring, ring, ring, we drip too hard, ayy
Yeah, ayy, look
I bring up money, they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
Im mixin the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I dont fuck with him, then I cant rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap
I bring up hits and they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
One hell of a year and a nigga still droppin
They wanted to stop it, but they couldnt stop it
You told a story like shorty was feelin you
She told a story like she split the bill with you
Look at my story, man, no one could write it
Now I see a million, I dont get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Aint no real sense in me goin the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chefd me a whole different colorway
Please dont be stupid, its Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time Im in Dallas, Ill look for another
You niggas fell off and youll never recover
Poured up some Hi-Tech and wait til it bubble
Young Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double
Hit Eliantte and left with a puddle
Its me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble
Run up my check, my bitch sprinted the shuttle
Sign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother
Painted all black, the interior butter
I drip like a leak and thats word to my mother
Yeah, came out the street, gotta sleep with a cutter
Family a beast, we gon eat us a supper
My dick in her mouth like she teethin or somethin
Sound like it could be Drip Season this summer
Aint no comparin cause we number one
In black and white Chanel, I look like a nun
The police in shock, dont know who got a gun
Dont got what I got cause I shop in Milan
Its winter, I still took the top off the don
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you a upset they dont shine in the sun
Cuban link look like a box of crayons
Im still at the lot, tryna cop the Cayenne
I told the judge, Fuck it, Im goin on the run
You want it, my dawgsll look out for the bond
And Im gettin by, let em choose sides
We get Ms in by the shoe size
I dont fuck with yall type of kind

Bread winner like Im Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I dont get tired
From the trenches, now Im goin

Dont gotta drip, I can leave it to Gunna
Runnin this shit, only been out two summers
That 4x4 truck, I post 300
Boy, at whoever, they know how Im comin
Aint got no feelings, Im here for the money
Treat every club like a Magic on Monday
Niggas aint rich for real, they gettin fronted
Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, Ima switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like Im Usher
If she tell me No once, I wont even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like Ive been rich, I used to have nothin
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money aint even came in from the other one
Fuck it, Im hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a number one
They tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin up
Ever catch me out in traffic, Im cuttin up
Every city we go to, it be lit as fuck
Tryna put the police on us, get rid of us
And Im gettin by, let em choose sides
We get Ms in by the shoe size
I dont fuck with yall type of kind
I done seen all y’all dickride
Bread winner like Im Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I dont get tired
From the trenches, now Im goin
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch

Oh

Its where ever you wanna go!
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League
Riding to the music, this is how we do it , all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music
Wouldve came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I cant let it go
Whether thats right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing
When Im alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow whats on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause Im running out of space
Elroy Jetson: Im somewhere out in space
In my 2-seater shes the one that I would take, wee
Riding to the music, this is how we do it , all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the, Aston Martin Music, Music
Wouldve came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I cant it let it go
Whether thats right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing
Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC, VVSs in the watch
Living fast where its all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it aint no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100
Riding to the music, this is how we do it , all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music
Wouldve came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I cant let it go, whether thats right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I wouldve came back, but I wouldve came back
Wouldve came back, wouldve came back
Wouldve came -
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

But Ill fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
Ill fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationships amazin still
I might just put up with the arguin and stay, for real
You lookin bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
Im willin to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that youll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin business
Is mindin your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
Its useless, all this fightin, lets get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around
Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Ayy, look at what we livin in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin, but I guess that you aint listenin
Rather run around with them nothin-ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smokin like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killin me, but soon its gon be killin you
To see her in that two-seater, know thats gon hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me by now?
So you go sleepin with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released, into the wind
Again, again, and deuces I must throw ya, peace
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin issues, you fuckin bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, Ima be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch 
Im stupid, but I wont get my drama on
What Im dealin with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk bout “you know who”
I dont know who you talkin bout
According to my old bish, I be on some new ish
She was on some oldish, now I got a new bish
Think I give two-ish? You aint gonna do ish
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better, youd do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better
So you gonna diss me
Even though you know it’s wrong
Know you gon miss me a little when I’m gone
Drizzy voice
Now Im ghost, baby, four-door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
Im bout my business, boys, plus I make paper
Come on, thats old news, yesterdays paper 
Oh, you talkin, what about?
If it aint how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut your mouth
Youll never score another me, Ill shut it out
Act like theres gum in your hair, girl, cut it out!
Got a pocket full of hundreds, she the only one thats missin
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it 
Got a racin Lamborghini, have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down, they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talkin ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in that Hall of Fame 
I let my denim sag, red Louis belt
How can you love me, baby? First, you gotta love yourself
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, aint gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it aint yours
I did things for her; aint rich, aint poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just aint know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody thats a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin up excuses
Chase Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin sad songs
Im on some new shit
Im chucking my deuces up to her 
Im moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye bye

Unless you want to play, you aint say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didnt budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasnt looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say Im busy, yo
Cause its too much, and its too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when youre away, I cant get you out of my mind
But what if Im not the one and youre wasting your time?
But you waited

Felt naked cause I laid out all my glory and my shame
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame
Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters
Im undoubtedly the hottest and thats just me bein modest
Go check the numbers dummy, thats just me gettin started
Im artistic, you    
Hold your applause
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, takin on the giants
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole
No false gods, young Mike playin against the Monstars
Tappin into 94 Nas
Or that 96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre
Which is really just Slim Shady, Im silly, my pen crazy
Today Im out in Philly, my fans waitin for 12 hours
Just to get their dollar signed
Thoughts stream like Im Spotifyin
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line
To these too cool for school niggas Im Columbine
Flow dumber than your projections
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet
Your covers keep perplexin me
Maybe its too complex for me
But is this bout skills or is this bout sales?
Cause either fuckin way, man all them niggas is less than me
You legends know that we rap

Been a minute since weve slept together
Finna get myself together
Ive been thinkin about everything
I dont know if its because Im lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, Im lonely
Ill admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, Im lonely
That shit ain’t my fault, girl cause Im lonely
Name another woman
Aint no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
Im running on empty, Im lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely
Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody’s yacht, that you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it, I’m not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, Im just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae
But name another woman
Aint no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
Im running on empty, Im lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

Yeah
Im home now, its over now, so...
Yeah
She got a thing for Chanel vintage that dropped before she could speak English
Do you love me or love seekin attention, I mean which one is it?
You keep callin me ya twin, but twins aint this different
Mentally Im already on next year, thats some 20/20 clear vision
You sayin let you finish, I aint tryna hear it
Im all for spiritual liftin, but I dont fly Spirit
Im all for findin happiness, but down to die serious
All smiles, Kevin Durant trials
Had to blow it on the court, I must have blew a milli
Im walkin on all charges, thats my new Achilles
I know they love to rock a check, but who gon do it really? Really?
My depositions never surface
Tanenbaum know the logo on the jersey, its gettin purchased
Ten years in and yall yet to hear my most impressive verses
Paid the cost to be the boss wasnt even my most expensive purchase
Trust when I say Im never on the shit they assumin Im on
Tales about me are like corridos in Culiacan
Sashimi from Saito, you know that man two Michelin Star
Postcard from Grace Bay, sendin my distant regards
Vision wasnt mine, told my niggas the vision was ours
Still a part of shorty even if weve been livin apart
Roxxll do you filthy for me soon as I give him the nod
Meanin hell blast for me like puttin the 6 with the God
Hop on a float to show the city the one they appointed
The one thats rebuildin schools and feedin the homeless
Hang with my niggas, but sometimes I be tryna avoid it
Cause theyll get to poppin out of place like they double jointed
Goals was the top of the pyramid in this shitty world
I gotta get the most of everything is the axis on which it sit and twirls
Point blank period, like a City Girl and then I bring it back to 50 world
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before Im gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, wont you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Dont wait til some other day, no, no
They love to wait til its too late, its too late
This different right here, yo
I was nominated, never won a Grammy
But I understand, theyll never understand me
Lot of lives lost, but I never panicked
Lot of lines crossed, I never did a Xanny
A hundred room mansion but I felt abandoned
Love makin love, but where will love land me?
Jealous, so their bitches be actin like they sleepin on us
But they speakin on us, jewelers quote us even numbers
Still blowin smoke as angels float above us
Love givin back, but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale
Triple beam dream, a buck on the shades
I really seen things give mothers the shakes
I really bought cars for women on face
I know it seem odd, but money amazin
College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it
But we keep pushin, keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin, rebukin the devil
Livin on the edge, she keepin me level
Money come and go, Ima keep you forever
Money come and go, Ima keep you forever 
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma
Coming to America, really the set
Ill let your soul glow, Im keepin you wet
All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?
Holdin on your hands, your bodys a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, menages with bitches
Lobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish
Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest 
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before Im gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, wont you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Dont wait til some other day, no, no
They love to wait til its too late, too late 
Had a dream she was singin to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left, you wasnt actin right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My money bag heavy, got me packin light
You movin funny, can you fill my appetite?
Niggas conversations, a lot of it false
He own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars, but all of em parked
Your niggas money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, thats not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
Im always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin
Bitch, we on the real, its time to stop talkin 
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before Im gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, wont you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Dont wait til some other day, no, no

Only holdin up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin that I do is me beggin your pardon
Only tryin that I do is me tryin the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin I do is lyin out in the tropics
Only cryin I do is cryin from laughin bout it
Only lackin I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is Where the rest of my commas?
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin at you from all angles and sides
And they dont wanna see that you smilin from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to em
Give em nice things, but whats that to em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But thatll never happen the way Im watchin my step
That aint what Im bout
Im in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I cant make it with you, Ill make it without
They say take the good with the bad, Ill take it without
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin I figured it out?
Is there more? Yeah
Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
Ill let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
Theres still nothin they could really do
Its too bad reality checks dont cover the balances due
Whenever its time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop Im out of the deal
In the house playin DAngelo, How Does It Feel?
I got a fear of havin things on my mind when I die
What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin these songs when Im high?
Is there more to life than goin on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin somethin thats more important to find?
Like healin my soul, like family time
Is there more to life than just when Im feelin alive?
Is there more?
Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me 
Cupids shot me
My heartbeats racing 
Tempt me, drive me 
It feels so exciting
Thought of highly 
Its yours entirely
Ill be, Ill be more than a lover
More than a woman

Yeah
Pool in my eyes
As you beg, I testify that
I hate being alone
But you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when Im tripping
Oh, yes its difficult
Thank God Im Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news
Like, Dun-dun-dun-dun
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, cant close my eyes
Cant open my eyes, dont know what to do
Im in some kind of mood
Youre so beautiful, youre so beautiful
We gotta listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don’t know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin hot and heavy
Things are gettin hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you, girl, I know you
Girl, I know you know already
What havent we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldnt tell you whats not yours
You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that Ive been goin through it
Hopin everythings okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil sexual, with you
Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap
You were someone elses wife in fact
You didnt even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know whats next
Girl, I cant pretend
We gon have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you dont know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin hot and heavy
Things are gettin hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how its gon go down
I know you, babe
Girl, I know you know already
What havent we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldnt tell you whats not yours
Yeah, you know already
Tell you whats not yours
Tell you whats not yours
Part II
Six months since Ive been back in the Six
And I cant help but wonder how youve been, babe
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how youve been
Ive been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
Its weighin heavy on my mind
And I cant help but wonder how youve been, babe
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how youve been, babe
R. Kelly
You slipped out if you dont know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin hot and heavy
Things are gettin hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already

Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear em talking, I just dont know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, Im slowly embracing it
Doesnt come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams are who Im racing with
But you can see Im pacing it so that Im always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, thats who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
Octobers Own but its looking like July 4
I just wish theyd let you try it first
This time Im really going off, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
Ive missed them before
But wont miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night its fireworks
Every night its fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh
Im just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how Im placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasnt love, I just thought youd fuck with me
Who couldve predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags want to cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And Ill never forget it, baby, what an experience
You couldve been the one but it wasnt that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I shouldve looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
Ive missed them before
But wont miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night its fireworks
Every night its fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh
Everythin the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And hes still got his foot out, guilt tripping
Its been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better report
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now shes saying she more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
Im flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Lets stay together til were ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
Thats why Im really going off, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
Ive missed them before
But wont miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night its fireworks
Every night its fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks

Pure mind and pure soul I possess, He knows it
Anointed and protected, I was chosen

Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay?
If anybody knows, girl, you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it?—this isnt making sense
Why are we focused on things
That dont even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time
And sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man
Me and you are playing house
Start thinking that Im losing touch
Got a tight grip on you now
Maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home
I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If Im working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women
Cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that dont deserve it
I dont mean to do that shit on purpose
Its just that when I go home
I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6
And you dont ever come to where I stay at
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You dont ever come to where I stay at
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man

Swervin them potholes

Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head

But as of late, a lot of shit been goin sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin wet, she only 52
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantoms leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress, its like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show

But inside Im treadin water, steady tryna swim to shore
Im on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store

Long bread, I dont eat shortcake, how come I cant
Miss a woman like I cant miss court dates
Cheese, but shes not in this portrait
And yeah, lifes fine, but I dont portray

I dont want the glow, I want the glo-ray
And Ima fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearin bullshit, bring on the cow shit
Havent met a smell thats stinkier than our shit

So high up, I got birds in the condo
Ha, aint that a female dog?
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell, God
Weezy Baby, I go re-al hard

To do what I had to do, caught in the life
I cant let it go
Whether thats right, I will never know, oh-oh-oh
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient but waited too long
But I wouldve came back, but I wouldve came back for you
Wouldve came back, wouldve came back
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned
Bitches, whats up with ya?
I hate calling the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
Im urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
Youre never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
Im on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This aint the life that Im used to
Reintroduced to people Ive been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I wont remember?
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
Im halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I dont drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of yall got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, Ive been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we dont really fuck with, fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, Im not saying Im the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I havent hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, Ill never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back, I
Wouldve came back for you, I just needed time
To do what I had to do, caught in the life

Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
I-I- I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you werent excited
Theres no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty, here I go
Uh, should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
Im living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget? My memorys never faded
I cant relate to these haters, my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, Im on some martyr shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
Uh, Im 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
Its ironic cause my mother was a florist
And thats how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
Its happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-huh, thats word to the millions that they putting up
Im trying to do better than good enough
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I dont have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say You promised me you would never change
You promised me you would never change
Uh, am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on?
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on, now that Im on
I dont really want to worry bout getting back on
Im just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I dont know how to work a phone
But hit re-dial, youll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it
The one that Im laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldnt tell you where the fuck my head is
Im holding on by a thread
Its like Im high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just having the time of our lives right now
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I dont have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say You promised me you would never change
You promised me you would never change
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I start treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I havent seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time Im quick to forget
Im bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, Im starting it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
Yeah, I just need some closure

Go outside, big time forward, heh
Starboy dey here suh

Pay homage, I roll through the city like young Sheikh Mohammed
It cant be that hard to find us
Go to Jungle, pick up my Ethiopian goddess
Thats when words spread, a Bugatti is in the projects
The boy home, used to take the bus to the block
Now summertime whips come through and bust up the block
I remember seeing Nikks having to bust up a block
And sell the work right to hush, yall niggas must have forgot
But I was there Nas don shit, a couple things sit on my conscience
With that said, look at all we accomplished
Yea, sure this aint Compton but this aint a fairytale land neither
We all lost mad people, the city wild
They gave the task to a purposeful child
Verses start to get a little more personal now
But that’s cause everybody else sound is so played out though
Oliver North in the cut Dolced out though
A thousand dollar bottle it get poured straight out though
Im screaming OVO on the whole way out though
Im back boy for real, Im that boy for real
I got hits nigga, you just a batboy for real
Backwoods get peeled, I smoke away all the tears
Nothing was the same man, including yall careers
The new Cash Money, the new Roc-A-Fella
Bunch of young rich niggas, turn around if you jealous
Popping champagne over here
Girl it aint a thang over here
Throwing money fast over here
Blowing all this cash over here
Popping champagne over here 
Girl it aint a thang over here

You cant get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark
Late night like Left Eye, Im creepin
Assuming the worst cause I havent heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if youre duckin calls or missin calls
Cause youve been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I dont know how serious you take it
Cant offer much more, youve heard it before
That narrative for me isnt changin
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know theres more to me

Put your feet in this water, dont wanna get your hair wet
Weve hooked up a couple times, we aint took it there yet
You broke up with your man and aint been with nobody else
You like, Fuck these niggas, rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you cant trust nobody
You said, Do anything, but just dont lie to me
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the show then we got ghost
And when its after dark anything goes

You can, put your phone down, you’re gonna need two hands
 after dark
You cant get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

You know, I need you to be open like Kais kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hittin 
Soothin, keep it right there, no movin
Make my way around the bases-es
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein honest, I dont really know what patience is
Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this aint like you
This that new you, this aint high school 
I like best when youre fresh faced and no foundation
Willin and ready for the takin
Earth-shatterin, groundbreakin
Headscarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesnt come now, we’re one now
Did somebody…
Whod they say that baby look like?
Drake!
Cashed out, my neck is frozen

Slashin like Guns N Roses
You got options, but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it 
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it 
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when were mixin potion
Slashin like Guns N Roses
You got options, but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like

All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin
They dont read anymore, they dont even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I cant stand
Niggas we dont need anymore
All the niggas we dont need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin out at the doughnut shops
Talkin bout how the weathers changin
The ice is meltin as if the world is endin
She asked me
Who are you gonna be when its all over? When its all over?
She asked me
Who are you gonna be when its all over? When its all over?
I dont wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I aint even got a strap, if you think we really need one, Im on it
The last man fucked up, Ill take it since he doesnt want it

The last man fucked up, Ill take it since he doesnt want it
Cant think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment
All of this, its alcohol, its drugs, weed, its everything that you could ever imagine. Man, our sisters, our sisters, and our brothers, our brothers, need to stop this shit. They need to take a step up. Young girls are hot, and they will fuck anybody, anytime, anyway. Because they are so hot and young guys are, they are going for it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need to uh, uh, uh, uh educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot.

They need me to go, but I dont wanna leave
Rest in peace to Lil Keed
Fuck a pigeonhole, Im a night owl, this a different mode
I might have to make her paint a 6 on her pinky toe
Heard you with a shooting guard, just let a nigga know
I would have you courtside, not the middle row
All good, love, in a minute, though

Plus Im cookin up ambition on a kitchen stove
Pot start to bubble, see the suds, that shit good to go
Hoes say Im suave, but I cant get RICOd
Bro think he John Wayne, I bought him yellow stones

Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin

Smack the backside of his head like he Bart 
OVO 4L, we come out when it get dark 
Big stepper, he came in a Rolls, but he left in a stretcher 
Let my brother drive while I shoot, team effort 
Askin all these questions, bitch, you must think you Nadeska
The chopper like to feel on all the opps, its a molester 
I be with my gun like Rozay be with lemon pepper
She wanna hear some Afrobeats cause she just popped a Tesla
All that workin out, that nigga must think he a wrestler
But this aint UFC, this chopper came with a compressor 
This chopper came with a compressor 
This chopper came with a— 
This Glock 45 came with a switch 
If I was Will Smith, I wouldve slapped him with a stick
Put your hands in the air, its a stick-up 
Spin the same hood where I get my dick sucked 
If you standin on business, put your blick up 
Come around actin scary, get your shit took 
Fell in love with feelin dizzy, so I spizzin

Said you belong to the streets but the streets belong to me
Its like home to me 
Its like home to me
I tatted your passport up
Now its lookin like a arm sleeve
Just know that was all me
And when you see Chanel, I wish thats how you saw me
That shit you tell Chanel, I wish thats how you called me
That raw shit, that honesty, yeah
You know I love you more than all them niggas put together
And its a lot of niggas trust, I put the list together
And its a lot just to assume were meant to be together
You gotta live that shit for real, you cant just say whatever
You could never tell nobody that you held me down
If it was ride or die then you shouldve been dead right now
So I dont get how youre yelling at me
How much I gotta spend for you to pipe down? 
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down? 
All the things Ive done up until right now 
I need a thousand pages just to write it down 
Writing down these feelings, its been overdue 
Dont know how many pens its gonna take to get over you
How much I gotta pen for you to pipe down? 
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down?
Tried to run it back a hundred times
The world is yours, but the citys mine
I cant believe you put it on your mothers life
I cant believe you told me it was ride or die
Cause youre not here, somehow youre still alive
True enough I know you from the other side
I set my expectations way too high
Yeah, and I would listen to the lies that you would tell all night
Angel eyes, but youve been giving me hell all night
I know the book that you would write is a tell-some, not a tell-all
Just to make sure you well off, you would sell all rights
Why does your ex think we beefin, is that man alright?
That nigga cant even look at me, he fell off twice
And Im back poppin, I still remember the day I saw you
I was on your ass like back pockets
Niggas love to hate, but what is that stopping?
So much shit I wanted to say, straight to your face
Cause youre so two-faced, that I dont know which face
Youre the reason well be going separate ways
Youre the reason we cannot communicate
Its not the things you say, its what you dont say
Im not in your way, youre in your own way
So I dont get how youre yelling at me
How much I gotta spend for you to pipe down? 
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down? 
All the things Ive done up until right now 
I need a thousand pages just to write it down 
Writing down these feelings, its been overdue 
Dont know how many pens its gonna take to get over you
How much I gotta pen for you to pipe down? 
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down?
Baby, pipe down

I think thats what life is about
Truly findin yourself
And then closin your eyes and dyin in your sleep
Lifted are my days, my dreams are vivid colors 
The jet is low, they make me take your trips, we fly by 
No stress is on my brain, no worries here, Im chosen 
Made another way, my nigga, watch me go shine
When I close my eyes my world comes alive 
La-la-la-la-la-la
People grow, good times sometimes 
Real niggas in life survive 
And Im sailing to the edge of my mind
Nigga, double up life 
Set the tempo, got a nympho on my line 
Said she wanna unwind 
And Im focused on gettin more
They too stuck on gettin even, Im ready for it
We should really be together more
Cause I know we got some time but Im never sure
Catch me ten-toes in the limelight 
Fuck the world up, on my life, right

Pieces of myself that I should never lose
All these people that love you dont know you
How am I supposed to move?
Hey-ayy, hey-ayy, hey-yeah
How am I supposed to move?
All my niggas rally round me
Bold niggas gettin real italics round me
Finally circled, found the purple
Undisclosed amounts straight from Universal
Too commercial, leven years later I done found my purpose
Here I am, oh, they mad
Goin out swingin for em, goin out sad
Catch me ten-toes in the limelight 
Fuck the world up, on my life, right 
Sayin Im the one, she lie, lie

All these people that love you dont know you
How am I supposed to move?
Gettin more

Then I say: this that fuckin mob shit, this that fuckin player shit

Aw yeah, aw yeah, and my sound is what up right now

And they do whatever I want em to

We call that schemin up, we call that schemin up for real

Turn the lights down , lay the pipe down 
I aint Mr. Right, but Im Mr. Right Now

In a Lam truck , with my Richard on 
Got a pretty girl , that Im feelin on 
We in quarantine , but my Ms long 
Buddy lame-lame, he got friend-zoned 
Got a couple spots , and they all owned 
Bought a penthouse , cause Im never home 
Threw my heart out the window, feelings gone 
Threw my heart out the window, but

Put you in Chanel, Ima teach you how to stunt 
Slip and slide like a waterfall

I aint Mr. Right, but Im Mr. Right Now 
Turn your phone off, take your clothes off
Im a sav, but I fuck her to a slow song
Said the nail lady went and did her toes wrong
Said her last man was always playin Drake songs
Yeah, cellphones out when I roll up
Yeah, the nigga had a problem til I showed up
Everybody with a at before they name tough
Yeah, more concerned with blowing up than growing up
Yeah, said she wanna fuck to some SZA, wait
Cause I used to date SZA back in 08
If you cool with it, baby, she can still play
While I jump inside that box and have a field day
Im the slow stroke king, hit me anytime
And my goal is to get you to the finish line
I seen good movies end bad plenty times
So let me finish strong, girl
Ima slide anytime you want
Put you in Chanel, Ima teach you how to stunt

She want me to fuck her to some Keith Sweat 
But she stay in apartments I got beef at 
Pussy so good, I had to sneak back 
Hit her with my Glizzy, boy, I keep that
You fuck with the ones that fuck with you, what?
The niggas—, the bi—, the dumb-ass bitches wanna come up and lay up and give you pussy at, what?
Twelve? One oclock at night? Face-ass nigga, do I look dumb, stupid or slow?
Nigga, please, what the fuck is you talkin bout?
Just like you wanna stick a dick up in me, I want some motherfuckin money
And dont get in your motherfuckin feelings when you see me in the motherfuckin club randomly
And one of your niggas wanna get down on me
And I wanna give them some pussy cause they gave me some money

These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
Im in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, its clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirrors revealing
If you aint got it, you aint got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, I guess it does is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy Im just out here repping us
til I get to shake the hand of the man thats blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now Im the games single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
Imma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I cant resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them dont judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash thats my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I dont really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that Im the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it dont expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I dont expect for yall to get
Im nervous but Imma kill it cause they bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what yall want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
Im allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah
Uh, yeah, this what yall want
Octobers Very Own
Young Money
ATF
Thank me later in this bitch wasssup
Free Weezy in this bitch wasup
June 15th in this bitch wasup

Ooh, baby, yeah
Days in the sun
And nights in the rain
Summer is over, simple and plain
Found me some fun thats good for the pain
Already told you, I dont feel the same
I dont feel the same
Anywhere I go
I cant help but show
I dont feel the same
Anywhere I go
I cant help but know
I dont feel the same
Anywhere I go

You ever hear some slow tracks, you know what Im sayin?
With, like, some pimpin to it, or somethin
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin?
Big cup of Ac, Im drowsy
Im still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldnt even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me
Nah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Cant just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah
Cant just leave it off that way, nah
Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But heres another nothing that you made into something

Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
I’m grindin’, I’m grindin’, I’m grindin’ I promise

My girl like it rough she said “find me a diamond”
Her body be grindin’
Lord we be on every kind of narcotic
That make us believe, when we lyin’, we honest, I love you
Pick, Michael Jackson to Jordan to Tyson to Myers
Too much dirty money when the colors
Are washing the whites in the dryer my nigga
It ain’t rocket science just rockets
I sleep in pussy not pajamas, grindin
I got this shit down to a science, I turn in my project, A minus
Whew, I ain’t crazy, I’m krazy and all of my niggas chaotic
Dressed in all black like they gothic
Music too loud to hear sirens, we pop, pop, pop up where you stay
Knock, knock, knock, anyone home?
Pop, pop, pop, pop then we outtie
I need a bitch like Naomi to take off her clothes like Leilani for niggas that’s grindin’
Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
Man, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
The feds be spying on all of us nigga
These hoes be lying to all of us nigga
I got news for the monogamous niggas
Yo bitch fucking anonymous niggas
I done seen it all my nigga
Cause these hoes seeing all of my niggas
Cause what’s the hottest shit on these corners?
That’s me and all my niggas
Grind for all this shit, I ain’t ever fall for that bitch
Cause picking up the feather from a lovebird
Is like a medicine ball to that bitch
Well bring Gucci bag in this bitch
And you know whats stashed in that bitch
These niggas walk around with they chests out
Like Janet Jackson and shit
I’m sweatin’ grindin’ this bitch, I need a shrine in this bitch
Fuck double O seven, I work twenty-four seven
Ain’t got time to bond with no bitch

I don’t know what to call that shit 
I know, I’m selling all of my cars
I’m selling all of my watches
I’m selling diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don’t need that shit 
I’m a different breed with this shit 
I’m tryna turn M’s to B’s in this bitch 
And I ain’t ever pay to be with no bitch 
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed
Fifty mill in one room 
You, you could ask anyone out here who running the game?
And they’ll tell you the truth, man, they tell you 
Oh look, they fuck with me now 
I think they’re hearin me now 
Someone said, Nigga, they takin you seriously now
I’m like, I think they just might be scared of me now 
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day , niggas wrong every day 
Gone, goin to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe 
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin out of space
Mothafucka, that’s grindin
Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
Man, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
 Perfect timing
I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe
Then peek inside the safe and say I’m running out of space
Believe that
Scoob, find another oo-wop
Tell them niggas cool out
Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out
Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out
Top floor, window he get threw out
Deuce out, pussy bitches, deuce out
Flying out the crew out, they flew out
Invite em to my new house, my new house
I’m fucking every night up in my new house

I get big deposits, all my whips exotic
Revin the engine, woah
City dependin, I gotta finish it

She want a demon, yeah
She want a ring or some sort of arrangement, yeah
Somethings thats dangerous

She quick to say, No, cause she know she a diamond, yeah
She gettin quiet, yeah
She on a diet, she want a massage, yeah
Im tryna get intimate, ayy
Bank account never diminishin, yeah
Niggas are changing they images, yeah
Niggas act hard but they innocent, yeah
Hop in a tank and move militant, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Find me somewhere out in London, you know thats the hideaway
I need some head and some moral support from you right away
Since I been makin donations, see you like United Way 
Stories you told me bout him, I can see that its night and day 
Walkin from here to my bedroom, it feel like its miles away 
And Im still hard body, I dont fear nobody
Phantom whips Im ridin, all my friendships solid
I get big deposits, all my whips exotic
Trunk on the engine
Im on a mission, the Bronco two-fifty
Im out your division
I got em excited, know its been a lil minute
I left her delighted
Man, I love all of her Chrome Hearts, these suckers despised it
The touch is the Midas
She said, Fuck me and cum, I just do it like Loverboy Nike
Ordered the jet just for you and your friends
Chauffeur you round in that big body Benz
Got a lil bitch that came up from nothin
We shoppin in London and doin it big
Been in private, but we out in public
I know we the topic for you and your kids
Lifes Monopoly, goin broke not an option
If they couldve stopped it, they wouldve been did
They wouldve been dead
She could be the wig, dont play with my head
Dont you test my emotions
Dont be textin my phone every day, Ima leave it on read
Im diggin and strokin
My new bitch pussy wet like a ocean, I need a new spread
The solid one, chosen
Young Gun Wunna stay focused, I cant let em put me on edge
No, they cant put me on edge
I just bust down my wrist, and its rose gold, and its ahead
I just counted ten million, all cash, and got head from the Feds 
Yeah, I just told em if he play
Then we stoppin the growth of they dreads 
I just had a talk with the peppermint Porsche
Damn, Im never gon drive em this year 
Feel the panoramic doors 
We got fours and deuces, toast 
Im the big dog of my coast 
Micro minis with the scopes 
Aint tellin this bitch my goals 
Had her living at the Montrose 
Ima peep, but a player not poor 
I been thinkin bout selling my soul 
Take me out the country and drop me in apartments
She wont see me cry
I just put macaroni cheese in my pocket
And it came with the sides
I just put twenty mil inside a escrow
I dont give a fuck bout your life
You had a buzz, but that shit was too little

Hey, Instagram
This song Ive been writing, oh, for a few months
I dont know, I, I started writing it about family
Just came up now, so
Anybody feel any way about it, I dont give a fuck
Yeah
Yeah
Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that
I was here when you was asking where the love at
Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
I was wishin on a star when I was that
Ive been fortunate enough to have it my way
Im a fortune teller, listen to what I say
Member when we used to park up in my driveway
I always told it how it was, I never shy away
This life is really something you get lost in
I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
I had friends that only had half of they heart in
Its hard to accept now, and it was hard then
But I treated you like gold, I was all in
Spoiled rotten, they could smell you fore you walked in
Burnin incense in your new apartment
But you got no sense when it come to
Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that
How you feelin in your soul since you sold that?
Ill be better off without you, and we know that
You aint lookin at a nigga you could hold back
Like Im tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You sold me up the river, but I rowed back
You put me on the road without a roadmap
Im not tryna make no song, these are cold facts
You got some liquor at the house?
Yeah
Go get a shot, lets do a shot together
I dont see it
Okay, hahaha
Ayy
Being here wasnt in the plans
I do it for the Grahams, not the Gram
I do it for the fam, but still fuckin Uncle Sam
I tried to change for you, but that wasnt who I am
Even when being real is out of fashion
Niggas keep stealin my style, now we out here matchin
I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
I couldnt sit around and wait, I had to have it happen
Lost you to the game, I gotta face that
Really think I lost you like a ways back
Always sayin how a nigga never play fair
I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair
We started this from the bottom, now you alone there
Shit, you treat it like its home there
Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share
I still love you to my last days
I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced
I never thought Id see awards in a glass case
I couldve ended up in your crib with a masked face
It couldve went left on a couple bad days
When I visit my last place is the only time Im in last place
See me these days, I never got on a sad face
See me these days, I
Lost you to the game, and I see why
It was always you and I without the T-Y
This is not one of them stories that got three sides
This is not one of them stories you could rewind
Like Im tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back
You wrote me off and then you never wrote back
Im not tryna make no song, these are cold facts
Yes, sir
Hold on, hold on
Woo
Lord, I already passed on all that 

You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?
I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushin the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it aint right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Aint no salary cap in the dope game
Aint no collective bargainin on cocaine
So in other words, nigga, do your thing
Mind in one place, heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who dont have your heart in your rap shit
And got too fuckin comfy
Cause we still fuckin hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin faded, aw yeah Im fuckin faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aw yeah, I mustve made it
Rikers Island on this flow, eight months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out
Uh, stop playin, I aint with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches, Sheneneh, oh my goodness
This is Wayne’s world, and y’all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish you would bitch
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock .40s, nigga, you got 80 problems
Swimmin’ in the money, Ima need some fuckin goggles
Its better to give, but we dont give a fuck about em
I just came home, shit done got real, ho
Lil Weezyana, the boot nigga, steel toe
I aint workin with a full deck but I deal, ho
I just touched down, kick the motherfuckin field goal
Talkin ’bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that how-much-you-love-your-lady money
I know you fake, nigga, press your brakes, nigga
I’ll take you out, that’s a date, nigga
Im a grown-ass Blood, stop playin with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin’
I think you pussy cat, ha, Hello Kitty
I just throw the alley-oop to Drake Griffin
I lay em down, Tempurpedic
This shits a game of chess, you niggas think its cleavage
Its Young Money, yeah, tis the season
I give you the business, bitch this a business meetin
My niggas hungry, my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, Im straight, my girl a faggot

Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I dont have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back, but
Its hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipod
Always said Id say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I cant live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch thats married, I aint miss
24 hours from greatness, Im that close
Dont ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin Hovs show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldnt have it until I have the crown
But I dont wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet Im rolling round the fuckin city like your highness
Got niggas reactin without a sinus
Cause what Im working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I cant imagine how
Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that Im fuckin right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
Ive always been something that these labels cant buy
Especially if they tryin to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin Tez, Damn, Drake fly
And he just be like, Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on em?
He just take them records and he gas up on em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on em
Oh, they did, Po, at least they tried to
And thats what happen when you spitting whats inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And dont listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would mean that theres a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me
Boy, and to my city Im the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and its not because Im lazy
Im just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, Im gettin better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said, Cause this Ye shit, you better kill
And I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas, they aint never real

Its your fuckin birthday 
Its a fuckin celebration 
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like times out of our control
Its a celebration, oh oh
Its your birthday, baby, its your birthday
Yeah, whos gonna love you on your worst day?
You talk so tough
I know youre soft like buttercups
Reeses, Reeses, dont be ridiculous
Just say your piece and peace up like Ibiza
Cool your headtop, you hotter than Anitta
Bakin, baby, tell me where I need to—
To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldnt excite you
On your birthday
Its your brrrrrrr—
Its your fuckin birthday 
Its a fuckin celebration 
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like times out of our control 
Its a celebration, oh oh
They tried it, they went for it
All year and youre still here, just ignore it
If it aint the real thing, you dont want it
GG, CCs all on ya
Its your month and you know it 
And you know its real, dont gotta say it for you
And you know somebody home prayin for you
You say, Play this shit, they better play it 
For you , on time
And I miss the days that you was all mine
Havent been official in a long time
So tell me where I need to—
To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldnt excite you
On your birthday
Its your brrrrrrr—
Its your fuckin birthday 
Its a fuckin celebration 
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like times out of our control
Its a celebration, oh oh

You could thank me now, uh, go head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesnt always come so instead
Its okay, you could thank me now
Yeah
Well, alright
Here I go
Uh, Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately Ive been drinking like theres a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
Im on the brink of influential, Im here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesnt add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
Its December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, Im on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Whod have thought the route wed chosen
Would ever end up this scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And thats around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, y-you can thank me now
And oh my goodness youre welcome, youre welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
Yeah, thats how you know its going down
In case another chance never comes around
Y-You could thank me now , go head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesnt always come so instead
Its okay, you could thank me now 
Uh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think Im spending all my time with the wrong women
I think Ill have a chance at love and knowing me, Ill miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isnt realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
Im probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all, I guess thats how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of they soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at Hello
Because of what they allowed, where are they all now?
I know theyre somewhere watching
So Im trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, youll find it next to me
They tell me Im the hottest, guess we finally get to see
Im feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key
Thats probably why Im in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it—
Im sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
Im the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
Im in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And Im aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while Im still here in this position
Y-you could thank me now , go head 
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said 
But later doesnt always come so instead
Its okay, you could thank me now

Ima tell you, Ima tell you this right now
If you, if you woke up this mornin, nigga you winnin for real
I got a big amount, I took a different route
I am the pick of the litter
I was in juvy, they gave me community
I had to pick up some litter
I want it easy, please do not tease me
I wore my Yeezys to dinner
This is the season, I got the seasonin

Hood nigga, favorite spot was the Waffle House
Patty melt with the hash browns
Tryna avoid all the pat-downs
Tryna avoid all the lame hoes
Weirdos in the background
Blackout when I back out
Blow the horn for a pedestrian
Shawty ride like an equestrian
I bought the dress that she in
Red bottoms in his and hers
Got a Rollie in his and hers
Got a car in his and hers
Walk in the zoo and say, Pick a fur
Last night was a blur to me

Two girls in the pool kissin
Everywhere I go, the rod with me

Got the Billboard melodies
Rap is somethin I do on the side
Crossed over to the other side
And I didnt even have to die
Got the money and I never show it
Let a nigga try to play heroic
Michael Jackson talkin to me in my dreams
And he say, You bad and you know it
Better shamone with my check then

Niggas love to talk reckless
Then see me like best friends
Got the sand-colored FN

Now, let me gon hit that cup, one time fore a nigga hit that road

Puffing purple hash, welcome to my power circle
Sucker-free, no snitching and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rolling, rose-gold Rollies

Dont get my credit declined, give all the credit to Moms
I flipped the bird at the Bird — hey, whats for dinner? Popeyes
These chickens got bird flu, and they chirp, chirp too
Always sung, never flew, these boys Hot Girls too
If money grow on trees, I climb and rest in that bitch
Build a treehouse and knock the bird nest out that bitch
Stuck my neck out and shit, then got the heck out that shit
And when I did, I took the special effect out of that shit
Tunechi F round this bitch
The best thing left round this bitch
All you niggas some bitches, I feel like Hef round this bitch
You call her Stephanie, I call her Steph round this bitch
Now back to whippin the baby on some step mama shit

A blank check on your face, put some respek on my shit
Branches startin to shake, here comes the leaves, get the rake
I want my piece of the cake, it should be sweeter than cake
Here come the leaves, get the rake, and we aint leavin the rake

You playin wit the right one today
Your flag is a white one today
You wearin em tight ones today

This for Cita and Nae, this for my people and bae
I got three sons of a gun, them niggas keep me on safe
Hol up, I am the black god to the church
I am the fat boy to dessert
I am the landlord to the first, got two bangers
One of them go bada boom, one of them go bada bing
I taught these hoes how to love, I taught these boys how to lean
Im high in the sky and I twinkle

The mansion came with the sprinklers

Camo shorts and Bubba Kush
We can talk shed rather fuss
This and that bout such and such
Damn, where is the fucking trust

Then take a female to the Island
Then take her clothes off and do the honors
Yeah, now she hear Im with them other bitches
Yeah, I told her mind her fucking business
Shit she probably out here fucking niggas
Im fucking her friends
Now her friends aint even fucking with her
Damn, she text me all day and night
So pissed off she aint even spelling shit right
I text her back, and tell her its life
Now somebody tell them hoes, Im single for the night

Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I aint tripping on nothing, Im sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And Im single, yeah, Im single
And Im single, tonight Im single
And I aint tripping on nothing, Im sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight
Dreads braided to the back
Im chilling but my swag on full attack
And my girl acting like a brat
So when she call, I dont answer, I just write her back
She hate it when I do that shit
And when I get home she go through my shit
She call numbers back to see who that is
Man I hate it when she do that shit
Polo t-shirt, Polo drawers
Now make me take this Polo off
Girl you can get broken off
Yeah, I fuck you for an hour then I smoke it off
Swimming trunks and bathing suits
Then go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth
Dont wanna fuss, aint tryna fight
Man somebody tell them hoes Im single for the night
Yeah, Im single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I aint tripping on nothing, Im sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And Im single, yeah, Im single
And Im single, tonight Im single
And I aint tripping on nothing, Im sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight
Now she got on her fuck em dress
And I got on my double-breast
And he been fussing all day with her
And I make her feel special like a place kicker
She wanna be Weezy F Baby-sitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold up
She say she just playing
Then I falls in that pussy like quick sand
Hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hanging like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
Its about to get nasty, pork rinds
She came hard, both times
We both say we single, and we both lying
We both wrong, but it feel right
Put your hands up if you single for the night
Yeah, Im single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I aint tripping on nothing, Im sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And Im single, yeah, Im single

And I aint tripping on nothing, Im sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight
If youre single, put your hands up
If youre single, put your hands up
If youre single, put your-
If youre single tonight
If youre single, put your hands up
If youre single, put your hands up
If youre single

This is why I do this shit
I think they call this venting
Look, this is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that yall the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
That aint how it works, that aint how it goes
And I been getting high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing this as long as Im alive
So every word I utter will be mine
Dont believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please dont be scared of me, please dont be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isnt new
So please dont be scared of me, please dont be scared of me
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value then I would drop one
For every single thing he showed us
And Ill be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And Ima keep it honest, Im so tired of being subtle
Its just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned bout they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families this shit aint what it seems
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open
Dont believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please dont be scared of me, please dont be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isnt new
So please dont be scared of me, please dont be scared of me
Look, fuck all yall, we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chilling here
But its funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when youre there, sometimes the shit dont feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think Ive changed just cause my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think Im scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks Im fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though Im living out what you would call the dream
And my uncle aint even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isnt one of those forever things
Its funny how money can change everything
Dont believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please dont be scared of me, please dont be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isnt new

Its a madness
Check my account, its a madness 
Block that account, its a catfish 
Block that account, its a catfish 
Check my account, thats a madness
Check my account, thats a madness 
Block that account, thats a catfish
Block that account, thats a catfish
You dont know me, you better get to know me
Stand up tall, right next to Kobe
A young G, I had the weapon on me
Slice up work like pepperoni 
The police still arrest the homies
No statement, no testimony
Spit in your face with extra bogey
Its my time, I dont flex a Rollie
On cloud nine, a mans extra cozy 
I might switch it up and direct a movie
Pussyholes tried to execute me
Died and came back as Fela Kuti
Dont phone me, send a text to Julie
OVO, mans so unruly 
South by, ride out, no Suzuki
Got the Austin Powers, a mans extra groovy 
Front row, jacket tailor-made
Crackhead swag with the razor blade 
Red umbrella when I make it rain 
My whole team winnin, we dont play your game
Sound like me, but they aint the same 
See them online tryna fake the fame
They wanna bust jokes, they think Im Damon Wayans 
Its a madness
Check my account, its a madness 
Block that account, its a catfish
Block that account, its a catfish 
Check my account, thats a madness 
Check my account, thats a madness 
Block that account, its a catfish 
Block that account, its a catfish
Yeah, theyre nothin like me, Im a fuckin villain
Go against me, thats a tough decision 
Police wish I was stuck in prison
Fish-eye lens on my tunnel vision 
Real life greaze when I touch the riddim
Still the same guy when I touched a million
Record labels wanted us to listen
But its greatness only for the love of Britain
I say it how it is and no fucks are given
 So dont forget to remember me 
Especially all my enemies
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
The most solid gang that you will ever see 
Just came back from the embassy
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy
And now Im back on tour, so what you tellin me? 
 Taliban, Halloween 
Pull up in the whip with the gasoline 
Yeah, thats that boy from the magazine 
Bust my dance at the cash machine
Make her back it up, bounce on my trampoline
Like Martin Luther, man, I had a dream
Now its my world, you can have the scene
Its a madness
Check my account, its a madness
Block that account, its a catfish
Block that account, its a catfish
Check my account, thats a madness
Check my account, thats a madness
Block that account, its a catfish

Sometimes when I sit back and really let it register
I did everything I said I would, and said it first
I mean the worlds in denial, but they all know what Im headed for
Ah
We bout to feed these youngins to the metaverse
Meanwhile Im over here just tryna pen a verse
Cause Im done bein extra with the extroverts
The label used to wonder how Im supposed to stand next to Vert
Prolly never thought that I would get these legs to work
I work hard, but hard shit dont need no extra work
Thats why I show up in a sweatshirt and let it burn
The worlds mine, I just say, Fuck it, let it turn
The girls mine, I just say, Fuck it, have a turn
The G.O.A.T.s call me to the side like, Can we have a word?
I couldve fronted but I did this shit how I preferred 
Mmm, I know I should be humble, but its somethin I just havent learned
Soon enough I have to make these bad habits burn
Soon enough we bout to come and get the shit we earn
You not a fan now, but I remember when you used to be fanned out
Im guessin when the whole world loves you, people only got one way to stand out
All that time in the kitchen finally panned out
I put some flavor in a pot and took the bland out
I know my grandpa would have a heart attack if I pulled a hunnid grand out
So Im not gonna pull a hunnid grand out
Im hip-hop, do you fully understand?
Fully automatic with the jams and they dont jam
At the shows Im bout to start handin out programs
Cause yall need to get with the program
Im a grown-ass man, call me pops
Fuck around and take your phone ass man
Everybody know Jack, but they dont know Jack, man
They just know I got the flows and the hoes and the packed out shows
Aint too many cons when you playin with the pros
Cept for how your life get exposed, but I make that sacrifice for the life that I chose
I know in Toronto they got salt for the roads
But schools closed in Kentucky, so I like when it snowed
The kids carry chopsticks not for rice in the bowl
School counselors all know how they life is at home
Cold like the Minnesota Vikings at home
Before I met Drizzy, I knew he and I would get along
But its hard to crack jokes when you really want advice
I mean, whats it like to touch gold every time you touch a mic? Touchin heights, no one gets a touch in life
Fuckin right, young bachelor, whats a wife?
Once in a lifetime, til I say I want it twice
One of a kind, know your everything is one of mine
Wanted posters with my face, they know who Im wanted by
Yeah
Yeah
Cold hearts and heated floors
No parental guidance, I just see divorce
Therapy sessions, Im in the waiting room, readin Forbes
Abandonment issues Im gettin treated for
How much water can I fit under the bridge before it overflows?
My sons gotta learn that forgiveness is a lonely road
The cribs on his will like motor homes
Niggas love to try and test us like they know what we on
Chubbs got the magazine cover like Rolling Stone
Cause we already know how they rock, they throwin stones
Whenever you gettin bigger, theres growin pains
I got enough pull to make the city start throwin games
Im out here makin a mockery
I got my realtor out here playin Monopoly
How can I address you when you dont own property?
They only finesse you when you dont move properly
Destined for the win, but you dont get a prize out of me
Im destined for the top, but you cant get a rise out of me
Seven-fifty for the round canaries, and they glitterin
Man, you niggas drop trash, you litterin
Im overdeliverin to the point, its belittlin
I mean, the PTSD is triggerin
The profit is sickenin, the stones is shimmerin
Came from the north, but
I got hot as fuck, so aint no shiverin, yeah
Lucky me, people that dont fuck with me
Are linkin up with people that dont fuck with me to fuck with me
This shit is gettin ugly
And every situation is transactional
And every thing they sayin is irrational
And every way they movin is promotional
Everybodys actin irreplaceable, its like they aint disposable
My urges for revenge are uncontrollable
I know were gettin older though, yeah
But I gotta get a nigga back for that, its non-negotiable
Its not even debatable
Im gettin so rich, my musics not even relatable
I blow her head up, its an inflatable
Baby blue G class, I feel like a kid again
Prayin on my downfall dont make you religious, man
All I hear is plug talk comin from middleman
All I hear is tall tales comin from little men
When I say Bitch, Im very rarely referrin to women
Most of the bitches I know are niggas, they not even women
I know that sounds like Im bein funny, Im not even kidding
Same ones that say they run the game when they not even in it
To be honest, yall financial situations my biggest motivation
And how you should take that statement is based on what you makin
Whips and chains like a dominatrix, wap, pssh
If I see ya, I spit in ya faces, ha-tu
Daytonas with the green faces
Kentucky derby races, my presence in the spot is so abrasive
Box at the Churchill Downs, thats motivation, yeah
And shorty like, You know that boy Jack is goin places
I know

Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
Its probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If theres anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If youre looking for a purpose
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now Im off singing karaoke
Further than Ive ever been
So if you gotta go
If theres any way I can help
Isnt it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought youd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
Im always up too late, I worry bout you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope you dont get known for nothing crazy
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Dont be fooled by the money, Im still just young and unlucky
Im surprised you couldnt tell
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And youre looking for a purpose
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead

2AM again and Im thinkin bout
2AM again and Im thinkin, Should I come through?
Can I come kick, can I come kick with you?
2AM again and Im thinkin bout
Its 2AM and Im stuck up thinkin about the
Last time you were behind me, all in the mirror
I could see everything you would be doin
I could see everything, lookin at me like you love me
I know you dont love me
I never care long as I come first, you come on time
I reverse, you rewind, do it again
Stuck in time, do it again
All you ever say is, Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You dont ever come to me, yeah
You dont ever come, why you never come?
Will you ever come?
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
Why you never come to me, no?
Why you never come to me?
Why you never come to me, no?
This my time, its your turn
I know youre right
I know it burns to be in love
I know it burns to be another
One of your girls on the side like that
I know your kind, how you lie like that
I know youre mine when you bite it like that
I know youre mine when you put it like that
Guess you was right when you put it like that
I know now
I get the point, I hear you loud and clear
All this time Ive been playin your side
I couldve done better shit with my life
And waste no time on you
Got to move on cause you got me fucked up
I am confused from this point, I dont trust nobody, yeah
Out of my body, blowin my fuse out
Devil, please cut me loose, yeah, please cut me loose, oh
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You dont ever come to me, yeah
You dont ever come, why you never come?
Will you ever come?
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
Why you never come to me, no?
Why you never come to me?
Why you never come to me, no?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
For you, you, you, you, you, you
Never, never too late, late, late, late, late, late, late
Fall through, through, through, through
Its 2AM, its 2AM and Im on you 
Thinkin bout you 
Never knew another nigga I want bad as I want you, baby
Its 2AM and I confess I want you 
Its 2AM, its 2AM again
I might be thirsty for you
How can you blame me?
Oh, I might be thirsty for you
How can you blame me?
Oh, I might play circus for you
How do you want me?
I conjure up that coochie for you
Voodoo, Houdini
And I might be that hoochie for you

Just hung up the phone and I
Could already tell that youre comin home intoxicated, ooh
So you better take your time with me
Cause I remember last time you wouldnt make love to me
Then you fell fast asleep 
Wouldnt even talk to me, no
Say— Say Im so crazy, baby 
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
Please, for me
Since youre comin home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
I wanted you to race my mind, mind
They said you got high as the sky
Up all night just dancin, huh
I hit you like, Please come home to me 
But youre not understandin, no
You gon make me beg, make me plead 
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
I just figured you could make time for me
Since that youre comin home intoxicated, oh, yeah
Race my mind, I got the keys, please
Picture me rollin through downtown in a A4
Picture my signature on a pair of some J 4s
Picture me carin what niggas sayin on Wi-Fi they dont pay for
Knew I needed love, but I think I value the hate more
To push towards things that I prayed for
Retrograde energy shifts are what I was made for
And dont you dare hit me back with no K, sure
Soon as I tell you that you the one I would wait for
You too saucy, too flossy, you moved in and moved off me
All to be with niggas who just startin to move bossy
Maybe I just handled you too softly
Them boys got no Kelis in they blood
If your whole heart wasnt in it, I know a piece of it was
Posted that pic you sent me, it wasnt recent enough
How Im supposed to wife it? You not Ayesha enough
You love getting Td up
Love showin the cakes, you know that they eat it up
Love touchin the road as soon as its heatin up
Invited you over, you said that you showin up
All them spelling mistakes, I know that you drunk as fuck
All them other mistakes, lets let it be what it was
Them niggas just cant understand it
I want you to change my mind, Im praying you pulling up
Know who you be around, I know that they teaming up
Telling you you better off leavin me in the dust
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
Please, for me
Since youre comin home intoxicated, oh
For me, please

Yeah
Uh-huh
Uh, hardly home but always reppin
You hardly on and always second
When Im awake, you always restin
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I, Im doin classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas situations, they are all depressin
Thats why I never follow yall suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin good, but good can turn to better
Cause you the type to lose her, and Im about to get her
Its okay, its okay, its okay, its okay
Its okay, its okay, you can run and tell your friends

Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women dont get saved round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, Drake is just a younger you
And shawty wanna party, so dont let yo girl up out the house
Or therell be shots on TMZ of me givin her mouth-to-mouth
Now shes famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I dont ever play, but Im in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin money, goin duffle bag crazy
Sippin on Pink Floyd and puffin Wayne Brady
Damn, whose line is it anyways?
Im in a daze, you been amazed
Yall seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
Im on fire, yup, Ive been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin less than real
Put it to your life

Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, Im dope and yes Im focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, its
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, thats the type of shit Im on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like its a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like Im the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Lettermans Late Night
This that major moment youve been waitin on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?
Its okay, its okay, its okay, its okay
Its okay, its okay, you can run and tell your friends
That Im on, Im on, Im on, Im on
Im on, Im on, best believe I understand

Its okay, its okay, you can run and tell my city
Im on, Im on, Im on, Im on
Im on, come on, you can run and tell my city its on
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy
Soowoo, bitch, I do this shit, Ill erase you like I drew you, bitch

If you ask me, Im ready...
Ugh, Tez keeps tellin me he just turned 30
Havin dreams of bein single forever, hes gettin worried
And Im scared too, cause Im in the same boat
Good women are rare too, none of them have came close
Me I havent changed much, you know how I play it
Better safe than sorry
Stead of searchin for substance at every single party
Baby, bein part of this life
I feel like Im bound to end up with somebody thats been with everybody
I need you to rescue me from my destiny
Im tryna live right and give you whatevers left of me 
Cause you know life is what we make it
And a chance is like a picture, itd be nice if you just take it
Or let me take it for you, Im just down to ride
Or we can roll around the city til you finally decide
Ive got more than a thing for you, tattoo and an ink for you
Right over my heart, girl, Ill do the unthinkable
Moment of honesty
Someones gotta take the lead tonight
Whos it gonna be?
Im gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have somethin to say
You should say it right now
You should say it right now
You ready?
You give me a feelin that Ive never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
I deserve it, I think I deserve it, let it go
Its becoming somethin thats impossible to ignore
And I cant take it
I cant take it
I was wonderin, maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, Im ready 
If you ask me, Im ready 
I know you once said to me
This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be
Time is only wastin, so why wait for eventually?
If we gon do somethin bout it
We should do it right now
We should do it right now
Baby, uh
You give me a feelin that Ive never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
I deserve it, I know I deserve it, let it go
Its becoming somethin thats impossible to ignore
It is what we make it
I was wonderin, maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way, Im sayin...
If you ask me, Im ready 
If you ask me, Im ready 
Yeah, yeah
Sing...
Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away 
I cant say I came prepared
Im suspended in the air
Wont you come be in the sky with me?
I was wonderin, maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way, Im sayin...
If you ask me, Im ready 
If you ask me, Im ready 
If you ask me, Im ready 

Im still working on me
And Im coming back better for you 
Most times it was my selfishness and your helplessness that I took advantage of
You sit in the house and I be out and I know youre worried, up 
And you try and block it out
Im so sorry for letting you down 
I shouldve came home, came home sooner
Youd probably still be there if I
Came home, love you like I treat ya
Youd still be there
My girl, my lil baby speechless
Youd still be there, baby
Im still working on me 
And Im coming back with a plan and theres money in my hand, baby 
You said I was fucking up when I was out here fucking fans, damn, and it made you look crazy
Made you seem, made you feel, it was crazy 
While you sit in the house, I be out and you stay worried about me 
Ayy, yeah
Nights when I just needed to hold somebody
Feeling overwhelmed, shouldve told somebody
Picturin its me sending chills through your body
I just probably shouldve chilled til I saw you
How am I supposed to get to know somebody?
Nigga left his 20s and I still wanna party
I can not be trusted on my own with nobody
I can not be
If we broke it off then you know it wasnt painless
If she got a watch then you know its not a stainless
I was out here fucking fans, I was shameless
Yeah, and I know that
You was at the crib reading stories that they sent you
Most of that was bullshit but some of it I did do
Hard for me to justify the women I was into
Especially when the whole entire world wished they had you
Then I locked the door that night in Vegas cause I had to
Then I had a kid even though I never planned to
I cannot imagine when your girls gave you that news
I know that
Probably made you want to hit the streets on everything
Probably made you want to pour bleach on everything
Probably made you want to kill me on everything
Yeah, trust, I know that 
Calendar must say two, zero, one, four
Cause youre on the same shit that you was on before
I know youre not happy, girl, everybody know
Could see it in your boyfriend eyes at the show
Dont tell me let it go, Im a letting go pro
You dont wanna grow but we gotta outgrow
Went six digits on the lock screen code
You crack into that ho and its gon be a lot of smoke
We both getting rich but the trust getting broke
Tear me down with words but I know thats how you cope
Cover up a lot, cant cover up your soul
Know youre not happy, girl, everybody know

Yeah
Its Drizzy, baby
You already know what it is
Its the first time—Im high, its the first time I smoked in like 3 months
Im sorry, Mama, I had to do it to em
40 I see you
O, I see you, homie
I stayed late tonight, right?
You know what happen when I stay late, haha
Yeah
Boi-1da!
I swear, its like this every single time
Toronto, I got you
I got us
Yeah
Im a hard guy to get along with, get on a song with
When shit be going right, well, I just flip it to the wrong shit
The team that I belong to, the artists I put on with
Dont ever ask for nothing cause them niggas got their own shit
Me and Weezy are like a mouth full of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats, I call it playing checkers
Im never doing verses, Im forever giving lectures
If you trying to meet with money, Ill be happy to connect you
Life is better than its ever been
Scheduling million-dollar meetings with the president
Someone cut the lights on, where is Thomas Edison?
Got a a new condo, watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you tryna zone, I got a whole Swisher Sweet full
Rappers all liars and they women are deceitful
Add until they subtract me, Ill never be your equal
Last-Place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me, Just write every single thing you need down
And he got it for me, and Im as happy can be now
Bout to start balling like Im coming off a rebound
Yeah, and I should have the most bragging rights
Because a nigga spit crack—bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they tryna get their swagger right
Cause I done came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you, pussy-ass hater, you should do you
You aint heard of me, then you should go and get a Blues Clue
Oops! I mean a red clue; Waynes here, suu whoop
Bet he felt that like the end of a pool cue
But I aint banging, I aint waving no flag
Im ATF, but they aint seeing no badge
Its Heartbreak Drake, I hate to see em so sad
I can son you, see a little me in your dad
Im the same yellow boy that used to play up on Degrassi
Can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burning like a Camel Light; stupid ho, ash me
But dont ask me shit about me
And know the game really aint shit without me
She might have to pay me, but I dick her down free
Wanna know if its the truth? Then pull the zipper down and see
Yeah
Um...
Im going in
Drizzy, I got us, this is my promise
Ima bring that barrel to them bitches eyeliners
And what I make up would fuck up your skin
I pick the buck up and buck-buck, then buck-buck again
I would buttfuck your friend, then suck up her twin
I put the buck up to him
Then buck-buck and buck-buck and buck-buck again
Suck nut, you duck, fuck your unloving kin
Now, dont rub it in
Like Lubriderm on a new tattoo, I had to
Kick my princess up out my castle
Dad, who? Never had that dude, always had a black tool
Even when I was at school, cause bullies arent bulletproof
Red scarf, hoodie too, probably aint as hood as you
Stupid motherfucker, the only thing in the hood is you
I do everything good as you; no, I do everything better
I get paid for every letter, A-B-C, et cetera
Fetch a bone, like a dog, motherfucker
I am going for your neck in a sec
Intercept, bring it back like work in a trunk
And my exit coming up, yup, I am headed to the buck
Like, buck-buck again! Might fly to L.A. and just fuck Karrine
Nahh, fuck Karrine! Lets get bucks again
And fucking spend them bucks, and then, just fuck Karrine
If I told you, Ima do it, I did it
Got my city on my fitted, bout to pop it, lets get it
Lets get it, motherfucker, what you waiting on?
It is bout a minute past pissed and Im about to get shitted
Im with it if money is the it you want me with
And I probably just spit on the chick you want be with
And I hate a bony bitch, only like em only thick
And I own hip-hop; if you dont spit, Im gon evict
And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like Drake Drizzy Rogers
Or Drizzy Drake Rogers, Im too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game, Im too willing to play harder
So harder, I go, there he go
They chant MVP when I shoot a free throw
C.E.O., Jaz, what it do?
The haters on their face and in their ass is a shoe
Faster than you, badder than you
Radder than you, et cetera
I told you, I get paid by the letter, like:
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y
ZZ Top, yes, he rock
And me and Drizzy both wrote on Detox
That was just a footnote; how long can he could go?
Wondering when he stop? Bitch, when the beat stop
So Ima keep rocking til the sheet rock bend
Then, the heat I send burn skin
The end

M-M—, M-M—
No, Im never gangbangin in my blue Chucks
Money callin so I threw the deuce up
Yeah, they plottin on me but they gotta do somethin
Told my dawg two-somethin just to shoot somethin 
Left them niggas stretched out on the train tracks
Rather you than me, here come that payback
Got em lookin for that paper that they cant tax
Yayo so clean, I told em call it, Ajax
Hialeah celebrated when Fidel died
Patti LaBelle, who knew that we would sell pies?
Standin on your own is when you realize
When all the lights go out, thats when you see the real guys
Back to the real niggas glowin in the dark 
Never perfect but you know a nigga heart
A rich nigga thatll pull up to the park
Get on one knee and tell the kids that they are stars
Bullet wounds dont be covered by ObamaCare
Your funeral was way too soon, thats if your mama there
Real niggas deserve to live twice 
Plastic fork and some fried rice
Yeah, two-point-two for the Rafael Nadal
Dont act like youre happy for me now
Dont act like you wasnt prayin for catastrophic collapses
Catalog is immaculate
Still runnin the game, dont ask me about the practice
Ho, you go on vacation, dont ask me about relaxin
Not sure if you know but Im actually Michael Jackson
The man I see in the mirror is actually goin platinum
Unthinkable when I think of the way these niggas been actin
Yeah, I never did you nothin and you play like we family, huh?
Next thing, you wanna shoot me down, it cant be love
Not sure where you was tryna send it, it cant be up
That day you sounded like a bitch, you fancy, huh?
Damn, how can I forgive like this?
I gotta dead a lot of shit just to live like this
I had to fuck a lot of girls to get a kid like this
I had to get a lot of cribs to get a crib like this, nigga
Thats why Im movin all elusive
These boys on they last resort and its givin us all inclusive
Been spazzin since CB was chunkin up the deuces, nigga
Your shit was boo-boo, excuses, excuses, nigga
Brrrt, may I speak to pussy niggas?
I just call it like I see it, I aint even lookin, nigga
I just walk it like I speak and I aint speakin to them niggas
I aint starvin, Im just greedy, all I eat is pussy niggas
Dont wan see these pussy niggas, yall cant see me, pussy niggas
You keep talkin like you eatin, Ima feed you bullets, nigga
I might even cook a nigga, all my weed is cookies, nigga
Shove a 8-ball up her pussy like a fetus for me, nigga
I got bitches doin lines, Im Adidas to em, nigga
I got sentenced, took some time and it was easier than simple
Im so difficult to fathom like a fever in the winter
I got women in the Phantom with they cleavage out the window
Long hair, lot of tats and I smell like the pack
Money trail right on track
Whip that big body Maybach like its a little Pontiac
All my chains look like snakes, thats some real diamondbacks
Pull my hammer out her pussy, pull her nails out my back
I dont chill, I react
On the scale, my pockets fat, and to this whale, you like a ant
Im a dog, if you a dog, then pull your tail up out your ass
And on this Codeine, Im a turtle, it done shell-shocked my ass
Im the hottest on the cellblock, I promise
I can fly to check my mailbox, invoices soundin like Jill Scott
Pill popped, house in Hidden Hills on the hilltop

Money makes a man and thats a crime
If we all were rich, wed spend more time
With our daughters and sons, theyre losing their minds
We all feel hurt, heres mine, hear me now
Cause no guns are allowed in here tonight
Were gonna have a free-for-all, no fights
I wanna get lost in the crowd in here tonight
I need to hear my thoughts, turn the music up loud
Let the music play, me dont want no more gunplay
When the bodies hit the ground, theres nothing left to say, ay, ay
Me dont want to see no more innocent blood shed
Me dont want to see no more youth dead
Come hear me now
No guns are allowed in here tonight
Were gonna have a free-for-all, no fights
I wanna get lost in the crowd in here tonight
I need to hear my thoughts, turn the music up loud
Yeah, yeah, yeah, news from back home
This when it hurts to be gone
Two more young names to be carved out of stone
One summer day that went horribly wrong
Got my dawg on the phone
Cryin and sayin to leave him alone, but Im not leavin his side
I know that somebody died, somebodys child
Some people ducked down and some people hide
Some people just cannot react in time
Bullets do not choose a victim
It is the shooter that picks em
They just cant wait to get you in the system
The district attorney could use a conviction
Told you no guns and then you didnt listen
Life is so heavy with that on your soul
Dedicate this to Shyanne and Josh
And pour sumthin out for the lives that they stole
416
No guns are allowed in here tonight
Were gonna have a free-for-all, no fights
I wanna get lost in the crowd in here tonight
I need to hear my thoughts, turn the music up loud
Money makes a man and thats a crime
Money makes a man and thats a crime

And she tried fuckin a rapper to break up my heart
But my heart doesnt break
Soon as I link with these niggas, they feelings are written all over they face 
Okay, great, Im in the backroom of Wallys, I spent thirty thousand on somebodys grapes
We done did so many pull-ups on niggas, no wonder we gettin in shape
Too busy backin my words up with actions to ever go front in your face 
Shit done changed, billionaires talk to me different when they see my paystub from Lucian Grainge
Told myself that I would get through this verse, and Im not gonna mention the plane
But look at the plane
The fuck are we sayin? Fuck are we sayin?
Big 81, but I dont own a Harley
I ride in Mercedes with Shane 
Its me and Lil Harley, we wreckin this shit
Then we bout to go link with the gang 
And unlike that clock on the wall at your mama house
I do not have time to hang
Please dont reach out to me
Think watchin too much of Stephen done got to me
Verses too eas, Im servin them up by the threes
Im playin pool and the pool just connects to the beach
Ive been too solid to ever have stripes on my sneaks, you get what I mean?
Back in the day, my dawgs was puttin eight balls in the pockets of all of the fiends, and- 
That was back in the day
Now we involved in legitimate business
Baby, we came a long way
Sometimes I hop on the road by myself, and I listen to shit that you say
All of yall havin more followers than dollars
And thats why I cannot relate 
Load up the Drac
What else are they gonna play?
Its however niggas wan take it 
Im havin my way, Set out here havin his way
Qua out here havin his way, and like the third Migo, I take
Load up the Drac

We havin our way 
Havin my way in the city, get pulled out your britches
You talkin or trippin?
Go put all my cleats on, walkin, aint slippin 
Havin my way, now this shit like a business
Load up the bases, now I feel like Cal Ripken 
She had it her way, now she out of a Bentley 
 Fuck how you take it, we straight from the vacant 
I caught me some cases, then beat it, then raced it 
Seen they was hatin, no communication
No invitation, cut off circulation 
Blue or the red Bugatti, this the Matrix
Crosses all on my body, watch for Satan 
Im havin, GALLERY, LANVIN
No talkin, we smashin 
This one a classic, aint none of this average 
Sniper, Im snipin the bitch, Im assassin 
I piped her, then piped the bitch up for some action 
Dont even be braggin, these lil niggas maggots 
I dont even flex, that shit be on accident
Fell in my lap, hit your bitch on a accident

Load up the Drac

Im havin my way , Set out here havin his way 
Qua out here havin his way , and like the third Migo, I take

Then I go put that boy right in his place
They know that Im havin my way 
I was seventeen on a song with Drake
Its like an eviction notice when we droppin 
Cause niggas get moved out they space 
Two and a half, was going on three
But fuck it cause its worth the wait 
Not to be ignorant, but I want everything thats on the menu but whats on your plate 
I talk to God, He give me the faith 
I hit the boy if I need me a Drac 
I got a Richie that sit on my left 
But somehow, I always be pullin up late 
Aint been on Earth ever since I copped that rocket chain and took a trip outer space 
Ever since birth, my mama told me that they gon act cool, but they really hate 
I know my worth , so you aint gettin no verse if you talkin bout a lil K 
Make em say church 
When they see clarity diamonds and stones in my Jesus face
Aint gotta run cause this not a race 
Load up the Drac 
What else are they gon play 
Its however niggas wanna take it, ayy 
Im havin my way , Set out here havin his way

Where the car you were whippin in you video? 
Where the ice at, nigga? Where them pretty hoes? 
You a fraud, real niggas already know 
Broke-ass niggas, I cant stand em

Juicy J, that nigga fresh to death 
Smoke it til its nothing left
Peel off, then Im ghost in my Phantom
Talkin bout you poppin tags, nigga, you aint bought shit
Talkin bout a hunnid bottles, nigga, you aint popped shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga, you aint shot shit

Now that Im here, baby

Show me a good time 
Show me a good—show me a good

I live for the nights that I cant remember
With the people that I wont forget
Spending all the money I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I wont regret
Ive been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I aint trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, thats my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
Im the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you cant hold your liquor, better quit right now
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that Ive been through?
Its been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, lets get right
Now that Im here, baby
Show me a good time 
Show me a good time 
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time 
Yeah, uhh
How about you and all your morals
In that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight
And worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Cant get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do if they could
Its in our nature—young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground, though
So Imma spend another $10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it—Yup!
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that Ive been through?
Its been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, lets get right
Now that Im here, baby
Show me a good time 
Show me a good time 
Show me a good—show me a good

Ayy, yeah
Ayy, ayy 
Writin this from Florida with love 
When I linked with Mexiko, I knew I found a plug 
Rest in peace to Static, yellin Shawty want a thug, ayy
Bottles in the club, ayy, know I love to touch 
Weezy played that shit for me and Kobe on the bus
Went and got a chain for me, I had to give it up 
Niggas had they pistols loaded pointed at my truck, ayy
And you know that lesson stuck 
From that day I never touched the road without a 
Ayy, from that day I never saw the point in talkin tough 
Hasnt happened since, I guess you niggas know whats up 
Yeah, havent seen the 6ix in like a month 
Fuck that, Im back, baby, where the love? 
Rappers that I threw an alley-oop are throwin subs 
But they gotta dap me when they see me, thats whats up 
I let that shit slide, I got everything
I could lose it all if Im reactin to the petty things
Know that if I see you, Ima ask you if you said them things
YMB the gang and they down to stain anything, mhm
Yeah, thats right
YMB the gang and they down to stain anything, mhm

Rest in peace to Static, yellin Shawty want a thug, ayy
Bottles in the club, ayy, know she wanna fuck 
Weezy played that shit for me and Kobe on the bus
We aint even get to reminiscin what it was 
Moral of the story is the story finished us
Damn, and you know that lesson stuck 
Havent left the 6ix in like a month 
Fuck that, Im here, baby, where the love? 
Fuck that, Im here, baby, just because 
I would never leave, but I could, though

DJ Khaled!

Ayy
Homer hanging on my neck
The bracelet matches the set
My brother named his ting Nadal
Lets stop all that back and forth over the net
My mama wish I woulda went corporate
She wish I woulda went exec
I still turn to a CEO so the lifestyle she respect
Ayy, two sprinters to Quebec
Cherie, ou est mon bec?
They only givin niggas plus ones, so I never pull up to the Met
You know I gotta bring the set
You know I gotta bring the G-Block
You know I gotta bring the D-Block
Cause you know how sticky it get 
You know how sticky it get 
You know how sticky it get 
You know how sticky it get 
She want me to play with that cat 
She lovin how Im makin her wet 
You know how sticky it get 
Ayo Eric, bring them girls to the stage
Cause somebodys getting paid and
Free Big Slime out the cage and
Shawty try to play it cool but
Now she wish she woulda stayed cause
Every song that I made is
Ringin like I got engaged 
Love my guys, I wouldnt trade 
From the cradle to the grave 
Gordo got me on the wave 
Ant got me on the wave 
Couple hits, now you brave, boy
You niggas better behave 
All that pumpin up your chest 
All that talk about the best 
You know how sticky it gets
Yeah
If Im with two of em, then its a threesome
If she alone, you know she a freak one
If its an escort, its a police one
King of the hill, you know its a steep one
If we together, you know its a brief one
Back in the ocean you go, its a—
Its a deep one
Forgave niggas in they feelings, lucky for yall, we dont do civilians
You say I changed, I say that I millioned, I did
The toughest act to follows back on tour
Off-road Maybach, Pyrex trap
Virgil came back through the boy, damn
Thats somethin to me, niggas really had they back turned to me
I aint talkin my assistant when I say niggas down to pack somethin for me
Then they thought they had the trap set for me
How you really think that went for me?
Niggas gotta do a fact check for me
When everything is put to rest
And everybody takes a breath
And everything gets addressed
Its you alone with your regrets
All that pumpin up your chest
All that talk about the best
You know how sticky it gets
Like, we werent supposed to come up with something this clean

Yeah, look
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like Rs and Vs and Os
I dont really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasnt no cameras, wasnt no pose
Just like that one time at Chella
Good thing man werent pullin out phones
Stay in big six-six with woes
Man start dissin and doin reposts
They do anything except road
Still cant see them after it snows
I dont have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if Im gettin up close
Loyal to O cause Ive taken a oath
Versace hotel and Im takin the robes
Seen em in person, Im seein a ghost
They told me relax cause theyre takin control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and Im hottin it up
I need a shade mansion, a rooms not enough
Youre droppin some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, theyre followin us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed
I cant name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turnin these yutes into dust
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like Rs and Vs and Os
I dont really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasnt no cameras, wasnt no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
Good thing man werent pullin out phones
Think you know me? Thats not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slewed
Throwin up six like man had flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I wont lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried bout sellin out shoes
I dont give a fuck bout jeans and crep
Or goin to Milan or goin to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that and let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Cant do love cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
Ima just take my knots in cash
They can never tie me down, thats facts
All that bark but we know hes a cat
I dont really like goin tit for tat
Ima just come like tat-tat-tat

Hands down, Im too proud for love
But with eyes shut, its you Im thinkin of
But how we move from A to B, it cant be up to me
Cause you dont know who I was before you
And basically, to see a change in me
Id be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, but youre on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh, but maybe in time in time, in time, Ill tell you Im
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that Im a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I know you told me break their hearts
But its you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I, they know I
I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff cause youre my baby
I love you, love you, a little bit
I would do it, you would say it
You would mean it, we could do it
It was you and I and only I, mmm
I think Im a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if youre a little bit
Little bit in love with me
I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as its official
Well have to let it go, go, go
So we dont confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
Im just scared to learn a lesson
The pressures on, both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but its just, so wrong
I wonder where my world bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I aint the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well, tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that aint cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that
And as for you, I think I know youre the one
The closest Ive come, Im probably a
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that Im a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you, oh

How much better can I show my love for you
Than say I do, I do, I do?
I do, I do, I do
You may not know right where youre going, but
I do, I do, I do
And all the times you wasnt chosen, well, Ill make it up to you
All of the feelings youre not showing
When your rivers overflowing, mmm
Its the truth, swear to you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
And all that you are, I do
My single line of stars in noon
Reflection of the very moon, I do
I do, I do, I do
Show my love for you
Can I show my love for you?

This verse starts as my snipers hit their marks
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like, clap, clap, let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let em all go
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can’t afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple I think that we’re readys
Couple I think that we should waits
Are we actin like a couple? I’m just tryna get it straight
Cause I’m over here convinced that it’s too early for mistakes
And then
Oh, you had to change up the game
Oh, the weather is not the same
Now there’s only cloudy days
Can’t stand the rain in July
Oh July, there were fireworks explodin
But now it’s getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why, it’s just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night, every night was passionate
Plus, you met my mother even if it was an accident
I’m confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you for so long
I was planning on this on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed chivalry? They need to get their sentencin
Meanwhile we arguing and I can’t get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end
Oh, you had to change up the game
Oh, the weather is not the same
Now there’s only cloudy days
Can’t stand the rain in July
Oh July, there were fireworks explodin
But now it’s getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why, it’s just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall
See its funny cause I never thought this would end
But then the season changed
You were my, you were my, you were my girl
Shoulda made, shoulda made you my world
Shoulda done everything to make you happy, baby
Oh yeah
Can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for springtime
And I will turn into a butterfly
I will spread my wings and fly
And I’m too fly for this shit
Oh-a wooh

Yeah 
Yeah
Look, me and Lil Sandra bagging CDs in the bubble wrap
People recognize me from the TV, but Im done with that
People dont wanna see me succeed, this shit come with that
Even when I come back, I dont know if its me thats gonna be coming back
Soon as I left, I had to make peace with that
Dropped out of school cause nobody was teaching that
The Best Western is where a nigga was sleeping at
Daemen College booking me to pull up and speak the facts
Even if they make a movie bout us, this shitll be hard to re-enact
Dislocated shoulder, its hard to be always reaching back
All these IOUs, its hard for me to be keeping track
Friends that dedicated they life to just keepin me intact
Hard to pay 40, pay Noel, pay Niko back
All the nights I needed to vent to someone and CJ sat
All the nights Chubbs was pulling up where I need him at
All the times Mark was making sure that my luggage packed
Or times he had to double back 
I mean, even with his salary, you cant put no prices on that
There is no salary cap, there is no payin him back, for real
I wonder what it couldve been if I had snakes in the mix
Actually, I never wanna know cause we made it like this
Shots gotta fly either way, now I make it or miss
Overtime hours all good, we take it in shifts
What would you do if it wasnt this? Thats a hard one
The finish line is where I like to pull up and start from
Pain is just a place that I go to get the bars from
Anxietys a drug that I use to get the job done
Delusionals a space I like to think that Im far from
My son is the one thing I hate to be apart from
Bet against me, dont know where they getting the odds from
I know that when its done, Im going wherever Gods from
But I still dont know where I get the calm from
 Yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah 
Yeah
Look, gotta hold my head high with two dry eyes
I told you everything is fine, dawg, but I lied
I be tryna draw the line, but its a fine line
And Im drownin out the noise from the sideline
Sometime its louder than the voice I got in my mind
I cant even hear myself when I get quiet time
Like, how they tellin me Im done, when Im in my prime?
Theyve been tryna push a narrative since 09
And they even had my ass convinced a couple times
But that aint even the half, I had tougher times
Only look for sympathy inside my mothers eyes
And its whatever with them niggas on the other side
We got problems we could never really put aside
I cracked the door for us all, put my foot inside
I tried to kill them boys with kindness, but they wouldnt die
So now I kill em all for acting like they couldnt die 
My hard work doesnt just pay off, it pays all the family debts off
Im taking heads off, Future out here like Irving Azoff
Houses paid off, label paid off
My soul for the money wasnt the trade-off
Unlike most of you boys that fade off
I feel guilty taking some days off
Please dont google my net worth, the numbers are way off
I mean, if you comparin it to what I really made off with
Im more like Bernie with all the earnings that they came off
Trust me it was nothin light, holmes
They tried to give me a slice of the pie, and I took the knife home
I know you love me
Cant picture bein a hubby, finger too stubby to fit a ring on
Unless Kawhi wanna run it back
Other than that, the stringsll be unattached
Certified Lover Boy, Im not the one for cuddling or none of that
Yall music gets watered down, when you love em back
And you know what Im on, blowing past ya, owning masters
Said youre like a father figure to me, but now daddys not around so Im a bastard
Oh, of course, the only villain that show remorse when I owe you more
Soft spot for all the ones that came before, I cant ignore it
Im always tryna rekindle
From the bottom to the top, man, whats it like in the middle?
From the lemon faced radio host that love to be bitter
To my dogs in the game who wasnt pick of the litter
For the young Gs out here starting from the beginning
Nobody praying for you when you winning, dont forget it 
Woah, woah, woah-woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah-woah, woah
Woah, woah, ah
Said its hard when it starts to fade away
Said its hard when it starts to fade away
Yeah 
Said its hard when it starts to fade away
Hard when it starts to fade away
Its hard when the memories start to fade away
Said its hard when the memories start to fade away
 So beautiful

Hey there, pretty girl
You know exactly what you got
And I dont blame you at all
You cant resist it
Especially when the lights so bright
And the moneys so right

Houstatlantavegas , Houstatlantavegas

And it go, Hey now, now, watch her go down
Oh, oh
We all got dreams and we all star reachin
All start peakin, all-star weekend
One hotel room that all yall sleep in
Housekeeper knock to see if all yall decent
Young girls envy the life yall leadin
Never satisfied with a nice calm evenin
You be at the games lookin right all season
But you always with me on the night yall leavin
Ask Lo, ask Lo, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning youll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight, its prolly bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, its impossible to lose you
Uh, because I never had you, although I would be glad to
Id probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
I swear, I start to think that Im going crazy
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Cause the ones you throw will get her out of
Houstatlantavegas , Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas , Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas , Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas , Houstatlantavegas
And she dance to the song
And she dance to the song
And it go, Hey now, now, watch her go down

Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh
Dont go missing, fly with me
Dont go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Dont go missing, fly with me

For my nigga Hush
Yeah, look
Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees
Smokin on crushed leaves
They turn they back on everything we built, then they must bleed
Ive seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
Straps over territory they know we must keep
Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep
To tell me hurry up cause the bus leaves
Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves
My shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys
I cant do that normal type of life, is it just me?
Niggas steady try to ride the wave, but its rough seas
Im losin enough sleep dealin with envy
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
Its on Meech like its trendy
Runnin round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the citys empty, yeah
Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies
I need plenty
Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi
Whatevers in me, its takin over
I gotta bust it down, break it open
Until somebody starts takin notice, then we rollin
Yeah, then we rollin, then we rollin
Deep pockets on a nigga, I cant find my phone in
Now we rollin
Yeah, then we rollin, then we rollin
Deep pockets on a nigga, I cant find my phone in
Now we rollin
Look
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before Id ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin missions
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin
Now Im seein money off of hotlines blingin but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin, ambition
Mindin my business, buildin a business, et cetera
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
I always had a little somethin extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B, but wont impress ya
Look, I aint no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephews gettin taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin of acceptin offers
And easin tensions
Keepin family out of East Detention
And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center
Spots we got no business enterin
Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye
I had to find a way to get someones attention
Then we rollin, then we rollin
Deep pockets on a nigga, I cant find my phone in
Now we rollin
Yeah, then we rollin, then we rollin
Deep pockets on a nigga, I cant find my phone in

Yeah
Uh-huh
Um, uh-huh
Okay
Hello mothafucka, hey, hi, how ya durrn?
Its Weezy F Baby, come to take a shit and urine
On these toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
Im so official, all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out
You aint met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rollin with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin, kill you in the kitchen
The feds tryin to clip us, but we aint even trippin
Im goin in, Im goin in
Im goin in, Im goin in
And Ima go hard, and Ima go hard
And Ima go hard, and Ima go hard
Bitch Im goin in, Im goin in
Im goin in, Im goin in
And Ima go hard, and Ima go hard
And Ima go hard, and Ima go hard
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out cause I live in my workplace
Ill give you the business, so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
Im just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big-dicked bandit
Money flowin like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowin purple clouds, nigga Im so sky high
I aint cuttin anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though, Im so sci-fi
And I dont sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so Im cool in every hood spot
21 years and I aint ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin hook shots
Cover me, Im goin in, and buckin when the hook drop
Im goin in, Im goin in
Im goin in, Im goin in
And Ima go hard, and Ima go hard
And Ima go hard, and Ima go hard
Bitch Im goin in, Im goin in
Im goin in, Im goin in
And Ima go hard, and Ima go hard
And Ima go hard, and Ima go hard
It goes, hold up, wait one motherfuckin minute
Its the El Capitan, I got motherfuckin lieutenants
And if I said Im goin in then I motherfuckin meant it
And if I brought it in the club then Ima motherfuckin spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and Im motherfuckin in it
No need for a room, yeah you know Im fuckin in it
She actin like she not, but she know she fuckin wit it
She said I seen it all, I say No you fuckin didnt
You ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater?
She said I cant feel my legs, Im like Bitch, me neither
Im goin in, where should I begin?
I dont even know, maybe where my blunt ends
And Ima be a legend even when my life end
And Ima be a legend even when this night ends
Yeah I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said Im him, so Im nothin like them
Im goin in, Im goin in
Im goin in, Im goin in
And Ima go hard, and Ima go hard
And Ima go hard, and Ima go hard
Bitch Im goin in, Im goin in
Im goin in, Im goin in
And Ima go hard, and Ima go hard

Uh
Im just so far gone
Octobers own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on?
Where did we go wrong?
Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and its one I cant postpone
Meanin if it rains, Im the one its rainin on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me dont forget em and I promise that I wont
Feelin so distant from everyone Ive known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that weve thrown
Ive done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
Its only been three years
Look at how Ive grown
Im just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but Im the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it wont even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, its proven and its known
Im sittin in a chair but in the future its a throne
I know you like to worry, itll be better if you dont cause
You know everything gon be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put yall in this position, vent to yall but
40 Mama always say don’t ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah
Say
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile, unaware that its a strain
Its a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that youre the one to blame
Tryin to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
Its a weight thats on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So Im lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I can only feel his pain
Cause in Memphis, Tennessee theres only so much to attain
So Im filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesnt say that shit in vain
Im why your girl heart is in a sling
Call me Heartbreak Drake, Im the hardest one to tame
As a man, Im just honest, as an artist Im a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yeah, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah
Uh
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Swear I’m putting on
But they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on, like

I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
I meant every word that I said
You should have spent more time listening
All the things that I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a hold on
What makes you so ready right now
After I waited on you for so long
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?

Why you want to, why you want to
Why you want to, why you want to
I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
Even when you sleep in my bed
I know youre not mine officially
And all the things I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a hold on
What makes you so ready right now
After I waited on you for so long
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love

Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love

Add -rs and thats surely what we are
Flip it round, add -ve and lets see if this goes far
Full of chuckles and cuddles and sometimes, eye puddles

Waited on you for so long
Too many days since January
Im still sitting here alone
We shouldve did this already
Said I got a email today
Kind of thought that you forgot about me
But I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Dont tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where Ill be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely
Ready for us to get it on
Aint got a love to call steady
Hope it aint like that for long
Ill be your friend if you let me
Dont wanna come on strong
Cause too many people wanna get me
But you know I do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Dont tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where Ill be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
I get lonely too
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Dont tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where Ill be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too

Yeah, yeah 
 Yeah 
Know what I mean?
Freedom, know what I mean? 
Uh 
Yeah
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah
With every record, I be asking the masses to tune your hearts to me
I represent intelligent niggas that grew up harshly
But lately Ive been questioning, second guessing, whether or not Ive got something to offer since I done eluded poverty
Or has the money watered me down, that truth is hard for me
Like the second time I got cut from the junior varsity
Fightin back tears, I promised to switch gears
And said to myself Whatever you do, you wont do it partially
From this day forward, I move with a new ferocity
Ferrari coupe velocity, a fail-proof philosophy
Success is in the effort, so if a nigga tried his hardest
Im at peace knowing God aint deal it in this group of cards for me
Some people say that Im running third, they threw the bronze at me
Behind Drake and Dot, yeah, them niggas is superstars to me
Maybe deep down, Im afraid of my luminosity
So when you see me on red carpets, Im movin awkwardly
Posin all nervous, afraid of the judgement
And the thought of showin too much of my day is repugnant
I be keepin my kids away from the gaze of the public
Cause these days, it feel like hate is they favorite subject
Fuck it, attitude like a young OShea with a AK
Aimed at your brain, violate, and I bust it
I dont play when it come to family, thats one thing I refuse
Pimpin they kids out for views or just to be in the news
Could never be me, I piss in the celebrity tea
God with me on this record, this is Heavens EP
The tales official, the best nigga breathing, it just failed to hit you
You couldnt tell cause you fell for the bells and whistles
And thats an area I dont excel
Im from the Ville where young girls talk grown as hell
Thats raw, never saw one person go to Yale
But every nigga that I know done gone to jail
At least once, provin we the ones police hunt
For the pains, we smoke three blunts the size of tree trunks
Too much hunger, its no wonder these niggas cant keep up
So saying Yes to a feature just means Im bout to eat lunch, bitch
Im goin for it, no never shall he punt
Im the one and you can be sure, speaking of beachfront
Im kickin my feet up while I write this in somewhere tropical
Supposed to be relaxin, this passion makes that impossible, mm 
Supposed to be relaxin, this passion makes that impossible
Follow the leaders
Another Gangsta Grillz classic
Like I never left
DJ Drama
Dreamville
D-Day

Wheezy outta here
My career bout to blast like bubbly
Im not waitin for her to say she love me
I can tell she fuck with me, man, trust me
I got a ten-year-old mink still aint fuzzy
Three-twenty-five on the dashboard
Ridin in the Porsche, rockin Tom Ford
I ball at Barneys, new Christian Dior
I took the jet to the New York store
She lick while Im drivin, Im stainin the floor
I took it off track, now Im ridin in sport 
You stay in your feelings, you never my boy
I cant come to the hood, I pull a decoy
Another body drop and they screamin my name
Im goin to L.A. on a private plane
Could never come back and my family straight 
Im touchable? No, Im too rich and too paid
Skeleton Cartier, black diamonds face
Pull up too deep like a fuckin parade
Old jealous-ass niggas tryna fuck up my pay 
Blast off, Rolls-Royce Cullinan rain 
I put baguettes in my wrist and my neck and my ears and my motherfuckin chains 
This drip out the trenches, I know you gon dig it, I come through this motherfucker plain 
I cut up my wrist, soakin wet and Coachella keep callin, they wont see the face
I took her to China and changed up her climate and now she aint talkin the same 
Five nights up, still poppin and ragin
The SVR still livin deranged 
I want her, she wanted the same
Hit em both same time, both glad that they came 
Keep me a vibe, but cant keep it contained
Know I keep me some dawgs, always keep em in training 
Tat a logo on the back of my brain
Dont ask me what the fuck am I thinkin
Back of these walls, Im full of that drank
Eric came through with a little entertainment 
Area 29, got it lookin like space
Houston, its a problem way we bustin up faces and shit
I came with the snakes, no squids 
I broke out the game with a 456
She lovin the fest, I see it
She lovin the fest 
Yeah, I see it on her face, and Im lovin that body
In lace, I know you lovin Spider and Jack
Yeah, I know you got taste, if you love yourself, take shots with me
If I love you, Ill drop you a pin to a time and a place 
YSLll put a nigga six feet
I aint beggin when I tell a bitch, Please
Me and lil Thugger on fleek
Now that lil ho wanna meet, ayy
What, what, what, what?
Fuck her on beat
OVO life not cheap
Im a young boy too Td
Wire just hit my account, never seen that amount, oh God, Im geeked
Been on the charts for five hundred weeks, so somebody love when I speak
Doin this shit just to show we get down in the 6, man, its bigger than me
Texas ranch so big, that shit is perfect for the dippin
I dont care how wet I get her, she wont catch me—
Three-twenty-five on the dashboard
Ride in the Porsche, rockin Tom Ford
Rockin her bed and the headboard
What, what, what, what?
Buyin out Louis and Christian Dior
I took the jet to the New York store
Park at the regular airport

Moment of honesty
Someones gotta take the lead tonight, whos it gonna be?
Im gonna sit right here and tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say, you should say it right now
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
Its becoming something thats impossible to ignore
And I cant take it
I was wondering, maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, Im ready 
If you ask me, Im ready 
I know you said to me
This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be
Time is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?
If we gonna do something about it, we should do it right now
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Its becoming something thats impossible to ignore
It is what we make it
I was wondering, maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, Im sayin
If you ask me, Im ready 
If you ask me, Im ready 
Yeah, yeah
Sayin
Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away 
I cant say, I cant compare
Im suspended in the air
Wont you come be in the sky with me?
I was wondering, maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, Im sayin
If you ask me, Im ready 
If you ask me, Im ready 
If you ask me, Im ready

They pay me to show you Ill do it again
Huh? Yeah

You know how October get hot 
Might make this glizzy go pop 
The crib is over the top 
The whip is over the top 
I thought about letting her go 
But I wasnt over the top
I cant be pale in my casket
Make sure I die with a tan, its part of the brand
I know that I came with a slide from left to right, but now I dont wanna dance
Cannot depend on the man
I slide her some bread in a jam, thats just who I am
Customs just wavin at us from the window
They dont even come on the plane when we land
Anyone else would retire, but Im not content
I wanna bury these niggas like twenty feet down so no one can find them again
Its gotta be scary to witness me carry these niggas around in both of my hands
They stay inviting me over, they say they got bitches
I get there and then its just them
Got a verse from the boy and it leaked 
He sent me a new one, said use it instead 
Everything good when you live in the hills
Got a chef and maid for a bed 
Can you imagine the shit that I seen?
I went from the Roy to the South to my dreams
The bridge got burnt and it shattered 
Im climbing, I dont need a ladder
New year, its a new chapter 
Got her Snap and I didnt even Snap her 
She wanna fuck out of anger 
Back in the days, life was so hard, in Pelham trapping backyards
I didnt even know bout Goyard

Remembering days in the courtyard

Trapping with bugs in the trap 
She wanna spill all the facts 
Yeah, yeah

My shooters think its tag 
She wanna buy me a Jag

Take the Draco, please make it messy

What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks?
Now we back in California, we dont even speak

Everyone said we look good on paper
You deserve that action
Plus you get more paper than I do, that shit attractive
Things that make me miss you, where Jen and Melissa

Look at me, look at me, look at I
Ballin out, swear I use to be shy
Young nigga
Back when I, was tryna make a, MI
My nigga, when can I
How is this shit goin how it is
I always seem to kill it and yet everybody lives
I hope that they remember me, for everything I did
Its some views from the 6

Yeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
Its been a moment since Ive done some public speaking
I find nowadays its, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is
Uh, look, Im the property of October
I aint drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rose and some shots over
I think better when Im not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, Im a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas Im the Group of Seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
Im the one twice over, Im the new eleven
And if I die Ima do it reppin, I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein me all hard
And lyin to they girls and drivin the same cars
Sittin there wishin their problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothin in common since I done became star
I done became bigger, swervin, writin in my peers lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineers name
One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriends waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin the shows gettin everyone nervous
Cause them hipsters gon have to get along with them hood niggas
Its all good, Im goin off like lights when the shows over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but Im no joker
Ill slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but Im no smoker
They just handin chips to me, nigga; no poker
Im with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, 06 Chris Paul shit

Private plane, pick location

And if the food aint on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fightin the drugs and gun charge

Red light on it like its recording

This a celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now
This took dedication
This is meditation, higher education
This the official, competitor elimination
I was taking trips, with Web to move weight
Came back to Queens, to hit up a new state
Bitches dont know the half like they flunked at math
Bitches aint have cut up, crack up in the stash
50 Cent Italian, icy flow
This that: run and get a dollar for the ice-cream cone
Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memorys only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers, niggas doing bids
This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Viola, Sharica
Candace, Thembi, Lauren, Aisha
Its a celebration 
Its times like these 
They know who we are by now 
Champion, the champions 
Yeah, okay, we made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erykah
Label transferred 20 million to Comerica
Its fucking terrible, its got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga, either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, Money aint a thang!
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game
They know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, dont even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rack
Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where Im at
Straight like that
Its a celebration 
Its times like these 
They know who we are by now 
Champion, the champions 
Straight balling in this bitch, Jeremy Lin; Melo
Tell me one thing you wont do: settle
Give me one word for your chain: yellow
Pocket full of money, black cars; ghetto
Critics say I aint in the game, A.I
Jeezy, how you deal with the fame? Stay high
Stay putting on for the town, may I?
What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high
Over a mil in three weeks, yeah, I did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, Im global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?
Don’t let me hit up Shawn Carter, hundred bottles of the Ace
Let me hit up Sean Combs, hundred cases to my place, lets celebrate
Its a celebration 
Its times like these 
They know who we are by now 
Champion, the champions 
What up, Nicki? Its Nasty, yeah
I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23
Im barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me
This aint rated PG, this rated PJ
Cause thats where a nigga from; murder on replay
My 24th b-day, Im sailing to Bermedy, you can see me on a yacht
Blasting Pac, little knot, I aint greedy
Im back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I dont fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan just one year to finish
My list look like this, first thing youll discover
The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other
Heres a man who clearly isnt basic
Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter: Fast Cash Life
Happily ever after
Champions
Its a celebration 
Its times like these 
They know who we are by now 

Uh
This might be too real, too real
Hold me closer in these
Trying times, supposed to be mine
Baby
I need some help just like anyone else
Hold me closer in these
Trying times, open your eyes
Baby
You said you felt something for me 
I dont know when
Based on the signals you send
Based on the way you apologized
When you came to see me and then 
You had the nerve to defend 
Mistakes that you made at the end
You said I was too invested
And thats what had forced you to go and pretend
I swear you crazy
Someone thats close to you reached out to me just to see if we had made amends 
Trust me, this aint bout revenge
But now I get along better with your friend 
And its wrong, I know 
But again 
Trust me, this aint bout revenge
I get along better with your friend 
And its wrong, I know, its wrong, I know, oh
No
You said you felt, you said you felt
Something thats different from everyone else
You had the nerve to still ask for my help
Dug you out ditches, you buried yourself, ah-oh
You said you fell
And I took your word that night in our hotel
One thing about time, surely, times gonna tell
Never had to work for much, so you said it yourself, ah-oh, oh
Cant let it go, cant get this out of me
This shit still bothers me
Dont you dare 
Dont say youre proud of me
Hurts just unreal to me
Now you wanna come crack to me 
Three whole years after me
Why did you wait til the end?
Trust me, this aint bout revenge
But now I get along better with your friend, friend
And it dont feel wrong, but again
Trust me, this aint bout revenge
I get along better with your friend
Oh, and its wrong, I know, but again
Trust me, this aint bout revenge

If I come around you, can I be myself?
Wind up in the mirror just to see yourself
If I was in your shoes, I would hate myself
Left all this behind to be with someone else, oh
Why should I fake it anymore?
If I firm the ting and work that can you take it anymore?
This time I have left, cannot be wasted anymore
You realize it now and you miss it
Texts go green, it hits a little different, dont it?
Know you miss the days when I was grippin on it
Know youre in a house tonight just thinkin on it
I moved on so long ago
I moved on so long ago
Youre still thinking bout me, though, oh
Im still tryna make sense of it all
Youre still saying things to keep me involved
Posed to let me know how you feel, now what to do?
It shouldnt take a text from me to speak your truth, rough
Youre dealing with me rough
I know you like it rough
But this might be too much
Youre dealing with me rough
I know you like it rough
But this might be too much
But this might be too much for me
Dodging girls on the scene and girls from my dreams
Well, dont wanna make something from nothing, thats where I be
Well, keep getting nothing from something, hows that fair to me?
Im thinking something for something, thats what I need
Im too behind in a race to rush for my lead
Im not rushing you, trust me, Im
Im the last person that needs to rush anything, wait
I feel like everything these days leads to nothing, wait
I feel like everything these days leads to nothing
Its clear that we all get lonely, then you call me
All I needed from you was to hold me down when things arent working
For some reason, I believed in you
Texts go green, it hits a little different, dont it?
Know you missed the days when I was grippin on it
Know youre in a house tonight just thinkin on it
I moved on so long ago
So long ago
I cant even remember when we lost each other
Was it last year? This year? Or some other?
Been so long since you said things that cover up the lies
We can do it this time
Just have some faith, we can do it this time
Your favorite thing to say, We can do it this time
Just have some faith, we can do it this time
Been dealing with me rough
Youre dealing with me rough
Youre dealing with me rough
Youre dealing with me rough

Put you inside a G-Class, thats just a starter kit
Plenty things count in life, but none of them is a thought of it
New piece around my neck, its chest games
Cause shorty stay with calculatin moves, like Beth Harmon
Swear Im more Purple Rain Prince than Prince Charmin
Disappointment, I stay expectin it, the pessimist gold medalist
Flushed the Magnums just so they not collectin my specimens, damn 
The way she with papi, man, you would think shes a veteran on remembrance

You used to do skincare, but now you do swimwear
Your ex-roommate got a condo thats downtown
But she got no furniture in the crib, Ive been there 
Checkmate, even though you hate that I even check her
Ill still get an E for effort
Only time I play the back and forth is Aaliyah record
If I let you talk first, then nobody is speakin second
Fluent in passive aggression, thats why you actin dismissive
Hearin me out for once would require you actually listen, damn 
The boy is back, I never turned my back
I just lapped em, so now all that they see is my back
Say that then, Maybach Benz with me in the back
When I was in Acura, still couldnt clean up my act
Whenever I tell the truth, you feel like you bein attacked
But that come with bein attached, so how bout we leave it at that? 
If youre gonna waste your time
Then waste your time with me
You can have all the space
More than you need
Its no pressure, girl
If you got time to waste

Uh
I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear youre the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time, whoa
When the lights dont glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything Im missing
And youll tell me youre in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We wont be here forever, and I realize I waited too long
But please dont move on
You dont need no one else
You dont need no one else
You dont need no one else
You dont need no one else, oh
You dont need no one else
You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go, whoa
When the lights dont glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything Im missing
And youll tell me youre in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We wont be here forever and I realize I waited too long
But please dont move on
You dont need no one else
You dont need no one else
You dont need no one else
You dont need no one else, oh
You dont need no one else
The girl or the world? You see, someone gotta lose
I thought that I could have it all, do I really gotta choose?
What good is all the cash if it doesnt buy time?
And what good is being famous if Im never on your mind?
Nights fallin, lights glowing
And Im just trying to pay the price owing
And I dont want to feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I aint tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga, nice going, is it worth it? That decision
Cause hearts break and I aint tryna be in that collision
So Ima dust my shirt and fix my pants
Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We wont be here forever and I realize I waited too long

Ayy, the blues is now kickin, and dinner is three Michelin
I dont eat red meat, but still got beef sizzlin
Know that I need discipline
I keep singin for all these hoes, they keep listenin
Niggas love to bro up with the boy and dap fists-es
But we are not equivalent, dawg
I been an only child, dont need siblings
And Im past them like the times that hes livin in, okay
Man, if you saw what I flew here, youd be like, Hes sickenin
If you not runnin some top, we not gon keep kickin it
Classics, I keep scribblin, lights in the Universal building just keep flickerin
Money just keep comin in, you would think Im Irish the way that it stays doublin
I could feed a country with the tax that I pay governments
Whatever theyre doin with my cash is very troublin
Okay, February came around, I used to get paid shovelin
Sold clothes, walked dogs, trust me, I stay hustlin
When it came to school, theres no way that Im A-plus-in it
So I just dropped out of it, trust me, Im not proud of it
Niggas get too comfy in they spot, they get knocked out of it
Niggas get a gun just so they can make props out of it
Shawty make a scene in the house, she get locked out of it
Yeah, you not bout to be chillin in this bitch with kicked feet up
Ima make you bounce out this ho like Big Freedia
Pete O. used to throw a purple tint on a two-liter
First private plane I ever rode was a eight-seater
Before that, I got the bedroom hot with a space heater
On top of that, I didnt have shit to my name either, thats real
But now Im givin house tours til its back to world tours
Play that Mask Off when they find the real cure
I might not be good for her, but Im real to her
Got no time for her, but give Richard Mille to her
Thats the only way I know how to express love
My dawgs love sticks and drums like they Questlove
All them jokes about Aubrey, they got me messed up, for real
I come with a lot of complications inside me
Its always people misleadin me that are tryna guide me
Everyone wants to try me, but no one wants to buy me
Everyone wants to meet me, but no one wants to keep me
Everyone talkin lemons when everything is peachy
Everyone got they hands out, and it aint to reach me
Mhm, yeah, mhm
Everyone got they glass out, lets drink to Weezy
Every nigga that stare me down just came to see me
Choppin up a lil cash cow, thats steak Im eatin
Check deposits, high-risers with extra closets
The sex platonic, I talk intelligent, text Ebonics
The electronic guitars whinin, thats just Nirvana
Tommy gun on the counter, I call it Mr. Thomas
Thatll keep niggas honest
Im dozin off in the driver seat cause the seat give massages
Decimal point money, these numbers too steep for commas
Im eye to eye with niggas, I cant help but to see beyond em
Got a two-seater problem
Niggas thinkin they cold, I knock the flu-season out em
Bitches forget they hoes, and thats when Tunechi remind em
I used to fuck Gucci models, Im fuckin Gucci designers
I keep it too G regardless, Im gettin too deep for divers
Let me resurface, Im flexin on purpose
She especially curvy, bet she be servin every purpose, perfect
Im better than perfect, Im sick, I need to see a medical person
Eatin all of these rappers with these edible verses
All I gotta be is all that I can possibly
She really, really into me, then suck it all up out of me
Im proud of me, I dont know how to be sorry, apologies
You fuckin with my math, you better know some trigonometry
Cause Ima be bustin, leave your lima bean at your mama feet
I flip the economy like Dominique Dawes
They say Im trippin, I guess they wishin I finally fall
I dont need war, I need a bitch that know Ima need yours
Ima need more, niggas is shifty like Honda Accords
Fire alarm, aint got no ceilings, we climbin the walls
Higher than yours, I fuck your bitch and she die in my arms
Lion has roared, No Ceilings 3 with my mind on the fourth

I have to watch the road
I swear that every car that passes has you in it
I can’t believe we’re finished
My life is movin’ fast
The time will often pass
And something will remind me
I can’t put this behind me
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could’ve had my all by now, by now
It’s been too many years for you to disappear
And have me asking the question
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, its not that Im surprised, its not I didnt try
Its not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you 
I wonder whatever became of you 
I wonder whatever became of you
I swear I heard you call
But when I heard youd gone
I hate that I looked desperate
You gone is like me naked
Im steering not to crash
Trying to make it last
Keeps looking close behind me
My eyesight on a memory
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could have all my love right now, by now
Gave into my fears
While you just disappeared
Thats why Im asking this question
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, its not that Im surprised, its not I didnt try
Its not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you 
I wonder whatever became of you 
I wonder whatever became of you 
I cant go to bed
Im thinking about my goals
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline
Where did the other half of my heart go?
Why am I in bed alone?
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?
Do you even live there?
Or did you take a U-Haul?
Too far, move off and not even tell me that youre gone?
We were on fire
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, its not that Im surprised, its not I didnt try
Its not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you 
I wonder whatever became of you 

Hey, hey, hey, come on
Were having too much fun right here
Shes got a secret, but I know
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper
Who needs a stage with the lights low?
Cause you already dropped the bullet and turned it into something major
Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then youre coming first 
Dont rush, go slow, I-I cant lie, Im impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close
Its a cabaret 
Cause even though Im a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret 
Youre giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
Youre giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
Fantasy, play the role
And all these new moves that Id like got me feeling like a stranger
Say my name, do you know
Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, its like were laying in the Manger
Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then youre coming first 
Dont rush, go slow, I-I cant lie, Im impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close
Its a cabaret 
Cause even though Im a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret 
Youre giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
Youre giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
Okay, this just in girl the paper so long
Always seem like I gotta wait for so long
So long til you get off from work, but listen
I got some better positions for you to take in for so long
Always strap up just for safety then go long
Then do my touchdown dance in it no clothes on
We might fuck around and slip tonight
Youre Kryptonite, you should probably have a cape to throw on
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do do the thing to ya, girl truth be told

Lamborghinis and them Bentleys on the V-set 
Louis lens iced up with the black diamonds

Born rich, born Uptown, born to win
Fully loaded , automatic 6 Benz 
Candy paint, foreign lights with my bitch in 
Born hustling , too big, nigga, to size me up 
Kept stunting, more money, burning up

Any kind of position, shes versatile
And she take it every way except personal, haha

Shit, I was taught to live and let live
So go and live it up, baby, giddy-up, baby

One day we gonna have to leave our love in the past
But for now it feel lovely, it feel great
I slide her: safe, ha

She throw that ass back and she never over-do it
Ha, she call me baby and I call her bae
Sorry for the wait, Carter 4 on the way
August 29
Hahahaha
Yeah
Fuck with me Drizzy

Don’t it seem like
Like I’m always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time
A terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working
Made me an addict
Theres way more people that want it
Than people that have it
I dont get it, I would hate to think I tricked ‘em
They fall victim to my system
Guess I sure know how to pick em
And I’m always her regret
Yeah, I’m always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever’s coming next
It goes up and down, it’s just up and down
She’s crying now but she’ll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
And expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she’s not the type to hold grudges
I’m wrong..
Bad boys aint no good
Good boys aint no fun
Lord knows that I should
Run off with the right one
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good 
Even though he breaks my heart so bad 
We got a special thing going on
Me and Mr. Wrong 
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Aint no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong
Hung up off your good
You call and I run

Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good 
Even though he breaks my heart so bad 
We got a special thing going on 
Me and Mr. Wrong 
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Aint no way that I’m moving on

A Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911

Plugged in with Colombians, I know Sosa

You want me to be the bad guy? Okay, its on then
Champagne spillin, crab cakes everywhere
My white bitch trippin, she say I aint playin fair
Im about to cop a tiger, and put it in the car seat

This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, youre used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who youve been with
Thats when I gotta hide what Im feeling inside
So you still think Im confident, and damn
Is this gonna last?
Youre up on a pedestal, are we moving too fast?
Feel like Im in crazy competition with the past
Thats why I gotta ask
Is anything Im doin brand new?
Brand new , brand new , brand new
Is anything Im doin brand new?
Brand new , brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl 
This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I dont ever question you, and damn
I cant even find the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself, but Im a couple steps behind
Thats why I gotta ask
Is anything Im doin brand new?
Brand new , brand new , brand new
Is anything Im doin brand new?
Brand new , brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl 
Is anything Im doin brand new?
New, new, new, new, new
Or is everything Im doing too late?
Late, late, late, late
Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me baby, am I too late?
Is anything Im doin brand new?
Brand new , brand new , brand new
Show me if this is brand new 

This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We couldve worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
Its funny how someone elses success brings pain
When youre no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin there but
Im gon need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
Im gon need you to say something, baby
Im gon need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa
Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart, girl, its sad to see
Your life is good, but me and you we a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy — its crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah
Is it my mistake, thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We couldve worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
Its funny how someone elses success brings pain
When youre no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin there but
Im gon need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
Im gon need you to say something, baby
Im gon need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa
Uh! I am the topic of conversation, this is celebration
Lets toast to the fact that Ive moved out my mamas basement
To a condo downtown, cause its all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now Im at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But Im addicted to this life, its gon be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that youve never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
Cause whats a star when its most important fan is missing?
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We couldve worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
Its funny how someone elses success brings pain
When youre no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin there but
Im gon need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
Im gon need you to say something, baby

Ive been thinkin maybe
Things were never the
Way we made em out to be
How we thought they were
Lately, Im not sure
One thing for sure
Is when were together
Were toxic as ever
Make no mistake, all the roads lead
To we shouldnt be together
I dont know why I
Still play into your palm
Even though I know what you want
Been twisted off you so long, oh-ho
Cause its complicated, far from simple
Always find a way to dodge these issues
Cant seem to shake it, not for nothing
The problem is were not discussin
All that screaming, yellings not becomin of you
Things just cant be fixed, were out of time
Time, oh yeah
Oh yeah 
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh, turns out I dont
Know, know you, no, not anymore, no
And I cant wait til we find a way to part ways
Seems like your days are dark days
Seems like youre mad at the small things, I
Admit it, it seems like youre playin it the hard way
We fight through the night, all day
I, I still dont know why I
Still play into your palm
Even though I know what you want
Ive been twisted on you for so long
For so long, girl 
Got me twisted, I could only wait for so long
For so long, girl 
Waited so long, but we got no time, no
Ooh, babe
Woah, oh
Woah, oh no
Ooh, babe
Woah, oh

Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what its gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didnt know much then but, probably tell you a lil somethin now
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and havent hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin
I cant stop her
New girl trippin but I cant drop her
Cause I need somethin to balance out the fact
That its hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin at labels
And they silencing you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See theres everybody else then theres one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the Earth face
Im gettin ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Yall eat pedigree as ya meal
Ive been Urkel for some years its better bein Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap its better bein this real
Its better drivin a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you aint gon see
In the club with a model spillin drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
Im in the Range bumpin Keyshia Cole
Singin off-key like 
Imma spare yall
Why you wanna judge me
I dont ever compare yall
The city is mine

Spring 07 second quarter Im droppin
With or without a label man Im committed to poppin
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin
Imma meet a lot of women Imma do a lot of shoppin
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I dont take it back
Same rappers thats all in ya face sayin Drake is wack
Are checkin my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
Imma do it cause I know I put you through it 
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
And say My babys famous and I knew it 
And it wasnt nothin to it
Ive drawn it and drew it til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out
Yeah
Id like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF 
Miss Andreena Mill
Closer to my dreams Im gettin higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said Im gettin higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like Ill never move on
Closer to my dreams
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin Trey in Atlanta to doin a cameo in his video
Which made everything right with X 
I got too many records and not enough shows
Far too many rappers and not enough ___
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer 05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin through back streets
On my Craig David shit the Artful Dodger
Shola Ama
I told her Imma
Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Timesve changed now Im older mama
And these niggas aint solid they fold in drama
And thats the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And Hi, haters
Im back off of hiatus
How ya album doin?
Im gettin cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home

Closer to my dreams Im gettin higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said Im gettin higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like Ill never move on

Im tryna do it all tonight, I got plans
I got a certain lust for life and as it stands
Everything is going as right as it can
They tryna shoot down my flight before it lands, before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me, then crawl back
I really wish yall would fall back
But gettin rich sposed to solve that
And these days, women make offers
And who the hell am I to say ?
My ex sendin late night texts
Cause she dont know how to let 
Uh, she in love
And as for them pretty light-skinned models
Standin in the cold, ah, yeah, they with us
Let them girls in for a drink and Im all in they ear
Sayin she should be the one I see every time that Im here
But when am I really even here?
Black Suburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old handprints on it
But Imma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in a Margiela tux, I dont really give a fuck
And we only gettin older
So what I tend to do is to think of today as the past
Its funny when you comin in first, but you hope that you last
You just hope that it last
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her, oh-oh
Throw your ones up in the air

Ayy, yo
Ayy, ayy
Oh
Finding myself
Showing myself
Finding a way to stay outta the way
Holding me back
Supposed to come right back
Guardin myself while Im all on display
I know you know all about it
I know, deep down, you feel the same
I know you know how I feel
I know you know how I feel
How do I, how do I feel? How do I feel?
How do you say to my face, Time heals?
Then go and leave me again, unreal
I see us fadin away
Im still holdin my breath for the day that you will
See that the effort I make is too real
How can you say that you know how I feel?
Ayy, whee
How can you say you know what Im feeling? Wait
Know what Im feeling, wait
You dont feel nothing, wait
Nothing is healing, wait
Time is just killing, wait
How can you say? Wait

Time isnt healing, wait
Time is revealing, wait
How are you feeling? Wait
You dont feel nothing

Waiting on Gucci Mane to call you

I got money that I saved then Im back on road

When I was in school, being African was a diss
Sounds like you need help saying my surname, Miss
Tried to communicate
But everyday is like another episode of Everybody Hates Chris
Ever since mum said, Son you are a king
I feel like Floyd when Im stepping into the ring
Just spoke to the boy, said hes flying in with a ting
Were touching the road to celebrate another win, were going in
Why am I repping these ends? Man I dont know
The government played roulette with my postcode
All I know is its where my people dem are suffering
I seen it before, narrate the story as it unfolds
Dad certified the settings and my mum knows
My mind full of more bullets than your gun holds
Now I got the peng tings in the front row
Saying, Skeppy come home, baby come home!
Yeah, I love the sun but I respect the rain
Look forward to good times, cant forget the pain
I was the kid in school with the £10 shoes
White socks, jack-ups and the pepper grains
Said theyre gonna respect me for my ambition

I am feeling good tonight
This thing got me thanking God for life
Oh, I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeah
I am feeling good tonight
This thing got me thanking God for life
I can’t explain

Shawty badder than a three-year-old
Keep playing and Ima eat her like a pita roll
Im just saying, with my love I could feed her soul
Two-day getaway and we dont need our clothes
We at the pool and she looking like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
And when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like a common cold
Damn you the shit
And Ill rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you
I say damn I must be left
Cause you the best I ever seen, right
Shawty put me on, you got me going like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he aint right
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
Lets get together over night
Shawty Im a pro and you are looking like the prototype
Ms. Cita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
Im cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for loving, ma Im hungry like a scavenger
I be on that lavender
I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner
Damn you the shit
And Ill rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you
Now she dont know about me but Ima put her on it
And she aint sure about me but cant go without me
We probably aint supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair could last forever
And shawty Im with you
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place
Damn you the shit
And Ill rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you
Damn you the shit
And Ill rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby

You finally start to care
I show up so unprepared
Youre ready for something new
Im still where I was last year
Meanwhile were talking it out
You keep leaving things at my house
Seems like youre wanting to stay
But you need to know..
Im on a wave, Im on a ride
Im everywhere, Im hard to find
You want a man, Im just a guy
Busy as fuck, you know whats up
Now got a life, back where I stay
Still pay a car note for this girl, around my way
You got the game and the talk
Keep turnin out how I thought
Kept my feelings on low, all alone
Intuition never ever wrong
So what the hell, mix some vodka with Italian
Carousel, hitting circles Im a stallion
And Im a real one nigga, Im my own med
You looking so damn thirsty, let me throw it back
Baby we are on to something, maybe if we had the time
Used to give my love for nothing, trust me, Ill be alright
Im on a wave, Im on a ride
Im everywhere, Im hard to find
You want a girl, Im on my grind
Busy as fuck, you know whats up
I got a life, back where I stay
Alicia’s still my only girl around my way
I said baby, Im on it, Im on it, Im on it
Baby Im on it, Im on it, Im on it
Im on a wave, wave
I said baby, Im on it, Im on it, Im on it
Baby Im on it, Im on it, Im on it

I feel good
Got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun?
Cause Imma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this, all this
I know Im blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?
Probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters
In time it’s all better, ‘cause time heal whatever
Imma need a moment cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, females are on regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friends with benefits til we ready
Now ready, Chandon got me feeling heavy
She like one more chance, more problems, no Biggie, ah
It’s all good, don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or give each other space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that
Tell your friend they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?
Im like...
I feel good
Got some time off, girl, its been so long
Did you have fun?
Cause Imma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this

You want that feeling back?

I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still…
Aint nobody like you
Heard you got a ballplayer
But he dont excite you
I aint the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me bite you
Still a superfreak
You know how I be when Im rolling in the streets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Ginuwine cause Im the same Ol G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies, arguing in Barneys, fly shit
Too much pride to say sorry
Shit, problems running like half the day
Number 24, let it fade away
She gotta leave but she wanna stay
She like how you feeling babe?
Like, shit
I feel good
Got some time off, girl, its been so long
Did you have fun?
Cause Imma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this
I know Im blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know

You say you want me, I dont ignore you
You said it first, but I meant it more girl

Nigga Im still doin my thing
Im still fly Im sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
Im still shuttin cities down every time I come around
Nigga Im still doin my thing

Responsible for everything you listen to
While mediocre talent proceeds to try and condition you
Took over my city and I never asked permission to;
Started poppin bottles cuz its ATL tradtion to
Celebrate at Bymark, fuck em at the SoHo
If there aint a elevator in it its a no go
Coldest thing droppin and these bitches want a snow blow
And they just give me head while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ shoulda won that
Nelissa and Wristpect, Man the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, holla at me when you done laps
Roll around with Niko, party with Azuka
Shout goes out to 1da, shout goes out to future
Shout goes out to Getty, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch just cant seem to hold it steady
Cuz I see the flame flickerin, ex-girls bickerin
Got these women jockin me from Heart Lake Road to Pickerin
Tried to send my nigga short some syrup out in Michigan
But my connect said itd take a minute if youre listenin
Please start doin you, I been doin me
And Im a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin me
But I got love for everybody even if youre suin me
My brother P-Reign knows, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot a officer in plain clothes
Starin at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hoppin on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just holla if you got me and fuck you if you had me
Shout out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver and 40, man you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to P-Plus
The names I mention are crucial; you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine
I am so sure of my rhymes
I could sacrifice a line like 
Yeah, haha, I swear I really fuckin does it
I had these niggas trippin, no luggage
Im still fly Im sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
Im still pullin out the phantom and these haters cant stand him

She got the head, knock your socks off
You aint gettin’ money, you aint fuckin with me
You aint in your bitch top five
I might pull up in the Six with Drizzy
I was just in Houston, fuckin’ with the mob ties
We dont never ever play two sides
Hang out the Phantom, its suicide

Y yo se que a veces soy un cabron 
Pero jamas te romperia el corazon
Hoy cobre quiniento mil, vamo a prender un blunt 
¿Quieres ir pa Cancun o pa Tokyo, Japon? , ey
Tu solo dime, dime 
Que contigo los voy a gastar 
Que pa ti siempre voy a estar
Ahora Jimmy Choo, yo no mas Superstar
Por ahi vienen los muchacho, me vienen a buscar
Hoy vamo pa la calle, no venga a molestar 
Ando en modo leyenda, en modo rockstar 
Pero yo soy tuyo y nadie lo va a cambiar
So, deja la perse , je
Que yo soy leal a ti
Siempre voy a estar aqui 
Quitate la ropa y empieza a moverte 
Que me gusta ma asi 
Cuando confias en mi, yeh-yeh-yeh
Si me altero me dice: Tranquilo, Gobi
Lo nuestro e infinito como lo Lakers con Kobe
Las mujere me persiguen, flow Bon Jovi
Pero por mi que se queden en el lobby
Yo no los voy a mandar a buscar, no 
Baby, cogelo con calma 
Yo soy tuyo dentro y fuera e la cama 
Mi bicho a ti te ama
Please dont let this go
We spent the last three summers on the road
Youre my best friend
Youre my best
I just dont want any war
No one at home
Que contigo los voy a gastar
Que pa ti siempre voy a estar
Ahora Jimmy Choo, yo no mas Superstar
Por ahi vienen los muchacho, me vienen a buscar
Hoy vamo pa la calle, no venga a molestar
Ando en modo leyenda, en modo rockstar

Freezing my times with you

Closed off my line for you

Standing in line for you 
Standing here for I dont know how long, girl
Things I wrote , lengths I go
Lets you know that I want you
Words we spoke , things you wrote
Let me know that you want me too

Pressing up against me real close

My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin
And my verses gettin stupider
Wayne if youre on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin up, so Im cuttin off my cellular
Im a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass, pause
Again, dammit yall, again
Yall, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in

Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me Id never be nothin but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, theres nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now its on and poppin
I always choose dough like its my only option
Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say Get it off your chest
And Im what all the fuss about
And if they talkin, I bet Im what they discussion bout
Hit me at the office, same extension

Room full of beautiful women but I want one
Room full of women and they notice me
Now all they wanna listen to is Jodeci
Freak in you 
Freak in you 
Is there a freak in you?

We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote Take Care, but they push me to the point where Im just not caring

Even when I got it I just gotta keep getting it
Big hotel suite, Im the only one in it
Always going back to some shit that I already been in
Plenty fish up in the sea but I never go fishing
We got everybody sick, sending get well soons and a lot of well wishes
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everythings a go
But I already know that
Im just more ready than petty nowadays, juss know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, Im watching yall clone
Im just more ready than...

Since Big aint here, Im about to do it for Tyanna
And put roses on the grave of Kanyes mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, getting beat on by they man
Respect women, I dont care if they a 2 or a 10
We dont beat on Kat Stacks, we just bring it to an end
And we dont wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There’s missing women out there, let’s just focus on them
This song is dedicated to Natalee Holloway
I feel for her daddy so I wrote this on fathers day
I know she gone, but she aint far away
I just had a daughter, pass me that cigar Ye
Im bout to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way, when police came our way
My daddy had his act on like it never happened 
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good, nigga she aint gotta deal with ya
You want some money nigga? I aint get a deal with ya
You aint saying nothing, you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air
Cause you coulda went out like your boy Steve McNair

Dont make the good girls go bad, no 
If you dont, you gon’ really love us 
Please don’t use us, dooon’t
Good evening, Im in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models but umm, I dont believe em
Whos still getting tested?
Wheres all the women that can still remember who they slept with?
Wheres all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list
But when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with?
Do it girl, Ill be the king to your Queen Latifah
I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl
This song remind me of Cat from Philly, a girl I used to love
Until she started acting silly, her hearts a little chilly
She a little too carefree
In 10 years, whos paying for all that therapy?
Umm, nigga not me, yeah
Im probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I’m done with bad bitches, know I’m coming straight to you good girl
Dont make the good girls go bad, no

Cant let the money and fame come between my crew

Ive been alone in my thoughts
Cant fill this void between us
I cannot stand losin you, woah, woah
All these feelings intertwined, oh
Fighting the urge to reach out
And my stance remains unchanged, baby
I cant help it, Im so into you
Oh, when youre ready
We can put this behind us
Baby, we can find us again, I know
Put this behind us
We can find us again
Cause I dont wanna go
I was alone, I was alone in this world
And I needed people
I know my funeral gon be lit cause of how I treated people
I dont wanna go, I dont wanna—
Swervin between emotions
I know we got real issues
Cant give in so easily, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Aint going out with no fight, no
Im just tryna play my part, yeah
Im not ready to let go, woah, woah
Oh, when youre ready
We can put this behind us
Baby, we can find us again, I know
Put this behind us
We can find us again
Cause I dont wanna go
I was alone, I was alone in this world
And I needed people
I know my funeral gon be lit cause of how I treated people

You ask how many girls I been with in my life
I tell ya, I stopped keeping count when I was 25
I ask you the same thing, you tell me, Seven guys
But we both know thats a lie
Cause if we countin head and if we countin drunken nights
Then that number that you gave just might be off by eight or nine
But its still nowhere close to mine
Marcus prolly had to bring me straps like thirty times
He took over like four years ago when Courtnee had resigned
I been talkin sex with Courtnee since like 2005
We been friends since junior high
Tough to enjoy the company and never cross the line
Shes like, Is it more than a hundred, with everyone combined?
And I say, Yeah, thats bein kind
At one point or another they all felt like they were mine
I had a lot of backs that I would never talk behind
Im not really into threesomes, I like one thing at a time
I like when its you and I
Plus I always feel like if somebody outperforms you
That could jeopardize your pride and Im not into choosin sides
Unless you bout to sleep and you askin me whats my side
Its the right at home, but this a hotel so you can decide
Lessons that I learned before hittin my prime
Confessions that I blame on the zodiac sign
Things you need to hear fore we say our goodbyes
Free myself of it all, watch a Scorpio rise
Yeah
You say you wanna know but you dont though
Why you wanna know who I cropped out of photos?
And lately, papi, you been acting tonto
What you think before you, I was only movin dolo
But Im honest til I die, so I wont lie
And I prolly got some numbers that you wont like
And youre prolly gonna hate it
But I much rather be hated for the truth than for the wrong guy if he aint done
You cant be this good without some badness
What? You think I fuck this good without some practice?
And if its LOV and youre my MVP
Then why we talkin about practice?
Like you want me to lie
Why would I jeopardize my worth, just to value your pride?
Confessions that I blame on the zodiac sign
Cause then I switch up and I blame it on my Gemini
Might be jealousy, cause you just want me tradin lives
Jealousy, cause I can get the girls and get the guys
And if Im honest, this whole convos just a waste of time

Fo real , for real 
I-I be splurgin’, Christian Dior, I got Chanel on order 
I met that girl and had to spoil her ‘cause that girl’s so loyal 
I met her when she was a dime and turned into a quarter 
We drank champagne just like it’s water, drink that lean like water
They told me hold back, that’s when I went hard 
I bought some guns, I bought some ice and bought some more lawyers
You try and take what I done sacrificed and worked hard for
I’m in that mode, I’m in that zone like when a nigga raw 
I’m celebratin’ every day, goddamn it I could be starvin’ 
Let’s have a toast to all my niggas runnin’ up in apartments 
We had a good year this year, we made a lot of fortunes 
And we very fortunate 
Who got that drink, hell yeah who got that drink 
They wanna pop champagne, yeah they wanna drink

Yeah, live from the Waldorf in Berlin
Coming at you once again
With stories of truth and stories of sin
Yeah
Yeah, the ball is in your court
No defense, nobodys keeping score
No offense but Ive played this before
Maybe you can and you just dont care anymore
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
Yeah
And I’m right back here when I said I wouldnt
You were never a good girl but youre a better woman now
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving, evolving
Look, you remind me of Jane Birkin, your body insane in person
Wanna do special things for you, you deserve it
But youre too famous to buy you purses
That barely scratches the surface
This time is different, you give me purpose
Tell me you taking it serious, I gotta ask how serious?
Cause your serious has just been not that serious
Got me on tour acting like Im not that curious
Ignoring all the pussy thats thrown at me
Been thinking bout home actually
Where Roxx has Kim and Mark has Ashley and Niks has Ezee
And I, I don’t even know what I have anymore
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
E...
We are not the same I am too reckless
Im not tryna go in that direction
These niggas they been doing too much flexing
And theyre about to call the wrong attention
And I aint got no patience, no more testing
I do shit how I want, dont need no blessing
XO niggas aint nothing to mess with
Nobody stopping us, oh no were destined
And everybody around you is so basic
Im never rocking white, Im like a racist
I dont drink my liquor with a chasin
And money is the only thing Im chasin
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Give me head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick
Tell her friends about it

Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be off that coke
Go tell your friends about it

Dont believe the rumours bitch, Im still a user
Im still rocking camo and still roll with shooters
Im a villain in my city, I just made another killing
Imma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin, everybody fucking
Pussy on the house, everybody fucking
And I miss my city man its been a minute
M.I.A. a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
Im just tryna live life through a new lens
Driving by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib I guess you call that shit a miracle
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it

My cousin said I made it big and its unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandmas funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded, when we want girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fucking table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
Its only meant to fall in love
That shit is pointless
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell them what you know, what you seen

Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it

All the false allegations 
Damn, damn, how did we get here?

Good girl gone bad, I can’t blame ya
Signs read danger 
Girl, you saying that you pregnant, I’m hopin its lies
While they all sound true, it’s sad girl, the things that I do
They all affect you
Like they don’t affect me
Girl, I’m mad cause the things you can’t see

The best thing we ever had, we take it in vain
All the missed calls got me thinkin

Shorty if you only knew, this is serious
Uh, I wish I wasnt famous
I wish I was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy
Thats when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I cant have
Wont even give me a chance
Claiming Im just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious
Up all night

She looked me in my eyes and said
Man, I aint worried bout nothin, I said shorty, you a beast
I love bad bitches, okay, whats the problem
If she thinks she gonna come up then Imma fuckin drown her
Im wilder than public schools and public housing

I was 15 with $100,000
And if you talk trash Imma fuckin possum
And nigga, if your bitch got eye problem
You know what it is, armed robbery
Tunechi
I heard em tell me Go get em, young
I havent seen a movie since I started livin one
I be in a room full of bitches gettin drunk
Smokin like a point guard, no look, passin blunts
Fuck you talkin bout? Euro, this and that
Wanna walk in these shoes? Have the outfit to match
And niggas schemin on what I had, but
We gon put money in the bag or a body in the bag 
And all these new bitches old news

Cant trust them hoes poking holes up in condoms
Put a S on her breast, she a supermodel

Now she say I got a fuckin problem
Because I fucked her once and gave a fuck about her
Her hair blown out like the 80s
I drive these bitches crazy, mental asylum should pay me

If you just give tonight to me

And I aint only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh baby I just landed
Bout to get my bags in

You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
Im here feeling like 50 back in ’02, and everybody sayin Im the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if Id be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but Im still playin like Im bein scouted til Im out it
Game time bitch, I hope youre proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin up
And I bet you I be out of time before Im out of luck
They aint rootin for me, they aint clappin for me
Im only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know
You know, you know
You know, you know
Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don’t get held up at the border
Yeah, so you can spare me all the accolades
Im the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And Im still spendin money from my actin days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin strings
So were courtside when LeBron get a fuckin ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that ’62 sittin outside? Thats me there
Im jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said itd be fair
Im always left wishin I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Crus, the Gajas and the Opuses
Its always nice when youre out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
Im just really hopin that that isn’t what your motive is
They aint rootin for me, they aint clappin for me
Im only sayin can somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know
You know, you know

You get in my bed, you twist up my head
Im changing for you, changing for you
You get in my bed, you twist up my head
Im changing for you, changing for you
You die with the lie
You lie and a piece of me dies
Inside out, I pray, so much I can take
Im here for the ride, your pride might be the reason why
We dont even make it to see the days
Woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Needed you, wanted you to stay mine
Winter came, you left me round my favorite time, yeah
We been down this road, past this street a hundred times
Claimed you havent eaten in days
Drinking your weight in champagne
Youre too busy dancing in the club to our songs
Turned up on my phone, changing your whole tone
Playing with my emotions, playing with my emotions
Playing with my emotions, playing with my emotions
Youre too busy dancing in the club to our songs
Turned up on my phone, playing with my emotions
Playing with my emotions, playing with my emotions
Playing with my emotions, playing with my emotions
Playing with my—
You get in my bed, you twist up my head
Im changing for you, changing for you
You get in my bed, you twist up my head
Im changing for you, changing for you
You die with the lie
You lie and a piece of me dies
Inside out, I pray, so much I can take
Im here for the ride, your pride might be the reason why
We dont even make it to see the days
Woah
Flying places cause you know the travel on me
Judging me lately, banging the gavel on me
Friends wanna tattle on me
You put your words together like you getting points for that shit, like you playing Scrabble on me
Your mama the sweetest lady, that apple fell far from the tree
Cant you be honest about your past? Like, how hard can it be?
You know I showed you them songs you been playing all on repeat
You found replacements for me, but you know its hard to compete
Woah
Calling me daddy, I taught you things that a father cant teach
At the beginning, it felt like youre going harder than me
Then you stepped back on this shit, girl, you hit the Harden on me
Woah, woah, woah, woah

Uh, when did you get like this?
Least you coulda done is gone and give me a warning
I dont regret like this
So Ill be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, This just aint my style
You cant say youre happy either
You dont even smile for me, no
Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree its a must?
Lets call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Lets call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before?
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store
Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree its a must?
Lets call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Lets call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Look, leave me, leave me, I cant fucking stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we posed to be together til the world end
But I dont really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all your sweaters and your heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call, you just tell me how I dont call you
Why you do that? Do that, do that, yeah
Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree its a must?
Lets call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Lets call the whole thing off

Getting late

Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
Im afraid, dont be

And Im struggling to let go
Although theres distance between us
Theres no place Id rather be
Owe you some hospitality
And it comes so naturally
Promise I just need some more time
If you can bear with me
When last did we feel this close together?
Chasing sunsets in California
Dont make me wait, babe, its been forever
Dont take forever
Its been forever
Dont take forever
Its been forever
Trust me, Im starting to realize
And look beyond my fears
Sun keeps on turning to twilight
Baby, we dont have long
I cant keep my hands off you
All night, all my love
You say its getting too late
Baby, dont be afraid
When last did we feel this close together?
Chasing sunsets in California
Dont make me wait, babe, its been forever
Dont take forever
Its been forever
Dont take forever
Its been forever
Giddy up, girl, best I can do

Double-cup love, you the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix? Then you should really get your fiend on

Look
I let the beat bang I dont claim colors
Honestly, the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter but when its winter time
Im still waitin on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi coast
Couple days on the beach then its adios 
Just look at what I done alone
You will swear we planted trees the way the moneys grown
We been busy like some bees no honeycomb
And you could prolly feel the breeze when the moneys blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
Ill never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when Im not functioning in tip-top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs
Drizzy
Uh
Im tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
Im a muhfuckin killa, killa, killa, killa
Uh
And Im the one to blame
Now that Im around shit will never be the same
Im a killa, killa, killa, killa, nigga
Listen, look
Before rap my last name was my lifestyle
And when I visualize success it look like right now
What was once gray skies is now white clouds
And I did it with the ones that yall said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps and youll see what Im bout
I keep my money coming in and never going out
From Chuck Taylors on the pavement with the blammas out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops bump you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped em out
I go for mine like its overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over shined
Been fucked bitches I been on my grind
Cause on a mission, your worst enemy is idle time
Hussle
Im tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
Im a muhfuckin killa, killa, killa, killa
Uh
And Im the one to blame
Now that Im around shit will never be the same

Spending every moment in the studio
I never said itd be fair
But when youre all alone, I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there
Come right in, set your bag down
Took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
Theyre fittin for what Im about to do, oh

Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl
And I know what to do with it

I took the night off for you
Girl, Im gonna turn the lights off, but keep your heels on
Theyre fittin for what were about to do
Come right in, set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
Theyre fittin for what Im about to do, oh

And be happy bout it cause she gets it

And all the stigmas that we have break my heart
But youre not ready
To open up your mind and be mature already
You focused on the shit you seen before already
Never laid no visions till they pure already

Of all the judgement they so insecure already

And how you stay shining? Bentley off the floor
And how you stay high? Purple pine dro
Diamond minks, fur, February snow
Take yourself a picture when Im standing at the mound
And I swear its going down, Im just repping for my town
Off a cup of C.J Gibson, man Im faded off the brown 
And I’m easily influenced by the niggas Im around 
See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound

You can look me in my eyes and see I aint myself
Cause if yall what I created then I hate myself

On the table where we see them
Im all day with it man, A.M to the P.M
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, thats that ish that drives me crazy

And I had to put that out there, Bun
Because a lot of niggas doin lot of Fugazi shit out here, man
Love me, save me, tell me, try me
All you do is lie to me
Takin me for granted, I could tell
All you do is lie to me
Lies dont excite me, Im lonely
Need more than a homie
Takin me for granted, I could tell
All you do is lie to me
And dub me, you never love me
Any confidence I came with, you take it from me
I just wanna get beside you and make you love me
I just can not take the silence, you keep ignorin me
See you makin all this time for more important things
We was sposed to catch a vibe the other night
Busy now, but you was down that other time
Why you always lead me on and give me signs?
I just wanna get beside and make you mine
I just wanna come inside and reunite
Got me waitin outside 
Love me, save me, tell me, try me
All you do is lie to me
Takin me for granted, I could tell
All you do is lie to me
Lies dont excite me, Im lonely
Need more than a homie
Takin me for granted, I could tell
Uhm, you was just so in your pocket, uhm
Cats used to tell me when they used to come to my house in Miami and shit
That, that, that they felt a feelin of like
They felt a lil fucked up in they stomach
But, they was inspired cause they knew they, they, they had somethin to see the dream for, you know?
I done seen a lot of shit, I aint never seen a, a young nigga as consistent as you that has affected the world in such a positive way since, you know, Michael Jackson
And then, when youve finally got the crib 
You did it like, not even none of us did it, you feel me? Uhm
Nah, I mean I did it like that, I aint gon lie, I aint gon lie to you
I did it like that, but, I aint never been affected by another nigga crib in the way that did it to inspire me
How cats told me that hed been inspired 
And felt that feelin in they gut, like I gotta work harder 
Well I mean workin harder just to compete, bro, for real, for real
Its either you fuckin in the game or youre out the game
Nigga, Im back in this motherfucker, lets get some money
Its over, nigga, you have arrived, top five, end of discussion
May God bless you, Inshallah, you know what Im sayin?
This your brother, Diddy, take that

I forgot about you last night
For the first time in a long time I did
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
An amazing conversation
With this girl named Lorraine, who says shes from L.A
And keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
She could be good for me yeahh
Thats when you text me
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine
And the fact shes right here with me
Shes starin in my face, somethin had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh
I hate getting, messages from you, from you
Its like you know the perfect shit to say
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
I hate getting messages from you, from you
Especially when you say you shouldve stayed
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh
Ooh, I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do

I dont care what you done, I dont care where you been
All you got do to is look over your shoulder
And look where God has walked you from
All you gotta do is look back
Just somebody look over your shoulder
Look where you come from, look where you come through
I come through the storms and rain
Look where I come from, I was down but now Im up
Look where I come from, by the grace of God
By the goodness of God, look where I come from
Remind me where Im from again 
Yeah, thats right, thats right
Tryna suppress the stress, you know?
Got a family tree that needs watering
A father that needs fathering
A mom that would probably prefer the whole mother-daughter thing, but we still rolling, you know?
Flipping my phone, soon as I wake
They callin my name, just another day
Cant bend, cant break
Cant let it show on my face
All of my mistakes, right there on display
All part of my story, skin thick as my shawty, yeah 
Flipping my phone, soon as I wake
Is everybody safe? Carrying the weight
Tell me what it takes to get everybody straight
The money in my safe, cant buy a clean slate
Clean isnt for me anyway
I dont want you to allow people to tell you that you are useless
Alright, alright, go ahead and tell em, go ahead and tell em
Because I want you to know, God told me to tell you this day You are useful 
You are valuable , and you are vital , to God
Vital, vital, on baby, on Bible
Remember what I left when I go
Remember what I said when I spoke
Please dont stand at my grave and cry though
Im not there, they made it so I can never really die though
So please dont stand at my grave and cry though
Pop champagne, scream my words
Let me leave on a high note
And dont let nobody call me an idol
Cause I was never sitting idle
And my people go where I go
Dont let nobody sell my house on the bridle
Worked too hard for the title
Worked too hard, where did life go?
Last thing I heard was Andre scream Ice cold
Past eight years feel like I had my eyes closed, blindfolded
Smoke before I make my decisions
Thats how I take the high road
Say I never get alone time, thats a lie though

Yeah, this dedicated to Canada man
The whole up North
A lot of people dont realize how cold it gets during the Winter
But listen
I met this new girl late June or early July
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
Now its December, Im driving, and shes like Wheres my hi?
Its weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
See that was a segue, I believe the matter
Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
Where the Timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
Where girls become exes from Summers caught hoin
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
And some places is breezy, and some it start snowin
And if you planning family vacations you better know when
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!
Yeah man
Its a funny thing going through the winter up here man
A lot of girls yknow, wanna get close
You might think they the one
But just wait, nah mean, take it slow
Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet
Since Im driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
She doesnt answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
Shes bold but I roll with it, Im impressed cause shes sweet
Then she says I heard your song and Im obsessed with the beat
I mean, the lyrics are good, but Im obsessed with the beat
I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
Theres a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat
Off this Im kinda taken back for a second
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session
And so I do, and its kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
Until we end up sexin and now my heart attached
Im thinkin off I shouldve been more Southern
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho!
Yeah, uh
I told yall I had a story for you right
Uh, ya man, its what it is
And now, Im proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
But, my boy say Im actin different, because I lay downtown
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
She tellin everyone Imma hold here down
Tell everyone Im the prince up in this cold clear town
And stupid me I just listen to her
Instead of wondering if this is really gon last me the whole year round
But then Spring shows up, and its Dallas in this bitch
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
When we were together, it seeming like way back when
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana
And its a shame, she had me convinced that she couldve been a dime
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime
I miss you, most of all, my darling
Give me a second to gather my thoughts
Strolling in the park 
And watching winter turn to spring 
Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on em right?
Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
Im still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss
Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby
I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
Now Drakes committed we waiting on the breakup
So we can get back to them cognac nights
With dress codes and light skinned girls that wont act right
And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
The winter came and blew his cold air through
Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
By the end of the week I would know that crew
And wed assembled a trio, a whole new scene
With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin
We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
But this Summer is different its a two man operation
Granted the fact that we one man short
Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
Cause handlin crack is a one man sport
Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin
I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin
The face, the breast, the bras, the toes
Im still solo and a long night draws to a close
Cause its a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside
Well never talk again, scary and true
That song Special I recorded with Voyce well its like a classified
Its what Im lookin for to carry me through
Yet I cant seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
And when they talk about they past and lovers
And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
Yet you find peace with yourself, now least theres some room to ride
Theres also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah)
Rich Homie Quan
Rich Homie Quan
Baby
All my niggas so hungry, man they just eat what they kill
I like convertible Bentleys and houses deep in the Hills
I might tell the whole crew come through
My squad gotta roll through come through
Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin
Because they sure do come true
Then I say: this that fuckin mob shit, this that fuckin player shit
This that shake a bottle up and bust the top and spray the shit
Bitches gettin dugout like where all the fuckin players sit
And like you just got traded
Girl you dont know who youre playin with
Aww yeah, aww yeah, my sound is what up right now
Ive been down, but Im up right now
Nigga been backstrokin and breaststrokin
Through that lane that you left open
Man I dont give a fuck right now
Let a nigga swim in the pussy on the low
Bout to go drown in the cup right now, holla
I dont know what it was about you
Like blue you left me without a clue
I pictured the fate, is it true?
Cause I tried to make this shit work
But it seems like you was in your feelings
You kept them hatin bitches all in our business
But I just got one question, baby
Tell me why?
Started from the bottom like Drake said
You the type of nigga get robbed wanna play dead
My squadll kick in your door where that safe at
No Atari, games girl I dont play that
If she broke I don’t acknowledge her, everything I say I follow up
What you talkin bout? Ummmm, Polo shirt, my collar up
Drippin on these hoes
Aint by myself, its a lot of us
Made a little money, still aint got enough
And if you got a nigga dead, put your lighter up
Keep my eyes open, dont say nothin
Motor geeked up like a razor
You dont know me, you must mistake me
For somebody else
But its somethin about you that I fell in love with
Your ex nigga, fuck him
I had to tell her that
I dont know what it was about you
Like blue you left me without a clue
I pictured the fate, is it true?
Cause I tried to make this shit work
But it seems like you was in your feelings
You kept them hatin bitches all in our business
But I just got one question, baby
Tell me why?
Question, baby, tell me why

Pluto!
DJ Drama!
Dram, Dram 
Astronaut talk
Okay, you know you been on my mind, A-Town, I miss you
When ol girl would come late and bring all her tips through
Break up her weed while I break down my issues
Get paper, she blows that, the next day, you know that
Daydream at night time I think too much
Then I hit the nightclub til its daytime and I drink too much
Not time for no good girl, they hold on and they cling too much
I just want a hood bitch that tell me that I sing too much
Awww, yeah, shout out to the women playing yall position
I be moving through my city like a politician
Hope you dont judge me cuz me and you are not all that different
You made me this way, you made me famous, you all assisted
New niggas tryna shine, I didnt condone it
But Im back in this bitch, re-living the moment
Im about to have it poppin off again
Drama bout to make it rain on Mary Poppins and her friends
We got....

Twenty goons, they in this bitch, you better check your tone

All I hang around is millionaires and a bunch of cons
Turn up, turn up, turn up its like a burnt a bunch of Suns

Addicted to making movies, I like em when they bougie
Anytime I step out, when I come through, its a zoovie
Aint rapping to ya, Im really trapping with words
And I aint braggin to ya when I say Im fly as a bird
That girl dont speak no Englo but she know all my lingo
She know a Rarri when she see one and she know a c-note

We could put them in a room together make a perfect combo
They bout that life, Im bout that life, yes we is, yes we is
The money, bitches and cars come with the life that I live
It shouldve been a designer party, all these designer round me
Pick a name, anything, money can buy what? Diamond chain

We toasted up to the life, niggas its ours
We got money in our pocket, and whatever youre sipping on

Uhh, red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast

You say you wanted fast? Define fast
Cause I could speed it up and make it last
And I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed
Im ready, Im wit it, still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage, well Im packed too
Plus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you
Bang! The baddest woman ever in the heart of South
Proven over and over again, thats why Im hard to doubt
Plus Im Young Money til the death, I took the Carter route

Cause its all part of my plan

You American faggot! Now after all the talk about how you would show up and never back out
Drake offered to put three grands on this battle to judge it
And you fucking backed out! Yeah, you little fucking pussy!
Im in front of DNA, wow! No fucking way!
This gotta be my lucky day
Im about to tie him to a leash in case he tries to fuckin run away
Yeah, the problem with you kids is that you lack respect
But fuck me over on money right now
And try to run out and Ima snap your neck
‘Cause people know
That backing out of battles is not part of my plans
But you and Cortez always lie, so not to my surprise
All your alibis came as a bunch of unauthorized scams
Shit, even if I met you in the middle of the East
Youd find a way to say that I ran
But Im from Los Angeles, Im proud to say that thats my land
In L.A. we support our home teams
We got a lot of pride, but goddamn
The way you ducked me in L.A. proves
Youll always be more of a fan of The Dodgers than I am
You soft as hell, Im not gonna lie, fam
In your battle with Rex, you almost copped a right hand
From Dot Mobbs hopping hypeman
When Rex made fun of your retarded mother
I know you wanted to fight, man
But then they called the cameras off
And you walked off and called it a night, damn!
Sort of like when Eminem told you
Lose yourself in the moment, you only get one shot in a life span!
And you answered him, like, I know, Slim!
Thats exactly why Im gonna walk away from this mic stand!
Your boy Cortez act on some G shit
We were supposed to battle here
He backed out, like, I need more cash now.
And that is some weak shit; hes a sneaky latino
So I wasnt surprised when I came to find out that he skipped
He was already flaking like a tortilla
So soon as I saw the guacamole on the side with the green chips
I knew it was only right that that bean dipped
It dont matter what battling league you actually be with
If you gon be dumb enough to bite the hand that you eat with
At least be smart enough
To cover up your tracks and dont leave prints
Someone call up Smack and tell him to cancel the field trip
Straps with the beams equipped
Like an active Marine ready to damage your queenship
Shells battering, the cannon ring until half of your team is seasick
The other half starts abandoning ship, panic and leap quick
In the same fashion that Hollow took his first chance to get green quick, turned his back on GT
Packed up his bags, took the cash and then he split
And the faggot hasnt been seen since
Its all a story that correlates if you go back and you read script
I use this all as a scenario to reference the battling scene with
‘Cause GrindTime is the ship
And this is bad as the Titanic sea gets
‘Cause without Smack you wouldnt be shit but lost talent stranded across the Atlantic sea without a raft to compete with
I got the long nose like X-Factor
Ill make the back of your Jeep flip
I said, youd think we were playing Xbox together
The way I left half of your screen split
My guns are barely legal with magazines thatll make this teen strip
Thats how you like it, right? Come back with a clean flip!
Yeah, Im ready for the drama
Aint no question marks, Ill rip your flesh apart like Jeffrey Dahmer
Lets get it poppin
Ill take the beef and steady chop it like a chef from Benihana
Speaking of chefs, shouts out to Cortezs mama
‘Cause I heard every GrandTime East Coast event
She be fixing Poison Pen his empanadas
Speaking of him, youd have to pick up the phone and Pen will call ya, ‘cause you too busy slumped over in the bed with Hoffa
Holding hands with Hollow
We all know you were raised by Dutch Vega and Sara Kana
Whats the beef between us? Its been a never-ending saga
Ill leave you walking around with Benders suppressed persona
When I Sketch Menace your necklace off ya
 deadly waters
Ill throw your body on the stretcher
And let the chopper off, boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-bah-boom-bah
And drop your paramedic helicopter
I do this for my fans, you mothafuckas aint shit to me
Are yall kidding me? Im fuckin bum-rushin the enemy
These knuckles will leave you bucklin instantly
I’ll fucking get 10 men to start punching you viciously
Uppercuts will leave your stomach in misery
Like muscular dystrophy
Thats for thinking you can come online publicly dissing me
You can pop your fists while Im still crushin you physically
This shit is childs play
You get ate side ways like the number infinity
I said, you need artist development
Before you come on the blog and then mention me
Ill stomp you out and make you a part of this history
Dont show me that, ‘cause this is about to be the bodybag of the century! Hold on! Hold on! You mothafuckas aint shit to me
They say karmas a bitch, for you its probably dentistry
Because the part of your mouth thats missing
Is only a reflection of whats scarring you mentally
So the gap between your teeth
Exists merely as an object of imagery to distract you from the real gap between us—and thats bars and delivery!
November 5th… its ironic, you know, my father died on this day
And I can still remember him telling me
Son, say what you mean, and mean what you say.
See, Im only 20, Diz
So in my past battles my emotions might have got carried away
Thats why I flew here to Canada
To make sure that wont happen today
So when I grip the 9, rip your spine
Make your body rewind—man, I dont mean that shit
Ill probably never clap the shit out you
But trust I mean every word when I say Ill smack the shit out you
The difference between entertainment and real life
Like, remember when I said Ill fuck you up in Vegas?
Well, dependin on how this battle goes, I still might
‘Cause, see, I still might
Move back, move back, what are you doing?
Gettin in my face tryin to go crazy
Tryin to fuck me up when its dead time
When Drakes here in front of the battle
But you aint gon make none of his headlines
What I was tryin to say was
That the difference between entertainment and real life
Like, remember when I said Id fuck you up in Vegas?
Well, dependin on how this battle goes, I still might
‘Cause me missin a tooth only means
Ive been in a real fight and got real stripes
So until you get tapped with a sucker punch and missing yours from an uppercut, then you know what this feels like
I took this battle for YouTube views, promotion and fanbase
So I made sure Im well prepared
Knowing my name would be buzzin in Sweden
China, Switzerland, making them well aware
So once I get rid of this storm, and yall see the weather clear
Just think about the end of every other natural disaster
You gone see DNA everywhere
Remember against A-Class when yall was supposed to go 60 seconds, then on the day of the battle this guy switched it?
Then remember against Swave you had timed rounds
But he said fuck it and you wound up rhymin for 9 minutes?
Then against me, this guy told Lush, Im rhymin till Im finished.
Which only proves further you got a problem with time limits
See, you the snake thats tryin to hide your rattle
Which only shows the Canadian Quarter
Aint the only bitch that flips when its time to battle
And thats when I realized, hmm
You really got a problem with time
Like when you say youre a terrorist and a hijacker, Im not gettin it
‘Cause if you detonate a bomb
What you gon set the time to? Unlimited?
You really got a problem with time
I discovered something, Diz, while I was watchin your battles
And nigga, you have never wore a watch in your battles!
You really have a problem with time
Its not opinion no more, its a fact, nigga
You do twelve lunchbreaks 
Change times whenever you want with your hat to the back
What the fuck you think you now? Black, nigga?
Yall all know, we really got a problem with time, but fuck that!
For the last two years youve been givin me the runaround
I managed to stay relevant
With every battle reaching over 200 thou
You done the same, but your musics trash
So the industry will never love your style
Which makes you a earthquake
‘Cause you always gone be a disaster that remains underground
See, you just an entertainer, Diz! In other words: a fuckin gimmick
And its for so long that the delivery can mask those fuckin lyrics
Your rhymes are put together sloppy and unorganized
Thats why besides GrindTime we aint fuckin with it
So battlin DNA will be the first time his verses have structure in it
So when you spit all aggressive with conviction
I be thinkin that you actually mad
And then understand why you hate us New York niggas
‘Cause he drive us around all the time in taxi cabs
Like his rap battle D, hes supposed to be the big bad Dizaster
And when I see DNA, Ima shoot him and let the 5th clap ya
I said Dizaster, lets fight! — he said Cool, Ima bitch-slap ya!
Soon as he hopped out the cab
All you hear on the radio is Dizaster, its your dispatcher
Please go pick up Plex Rock and Lush One
And stay away from DNA, you know you dont bust guns
You never touched drugs a day in your life or touched none
And hurry up, your moms calling, rents due, you must come!
So when you squint your fuckin eyebrows
And spit with alllll that aggression
I almost think you might really bust your Glock
But then again we saw him against Arsonal
And you aint look too good with that fuckin shot
You gon try to rebuttal everything I say
Dont act like you fuckin not, but its cool
‘Cause a good rebuttal only means I had to say somethin hot
So dont be confused when he rebuttal every lyric I say
And think hes clever with frees
‘Cause every time yall cheer for that great rebuttal
You only givin credit to me
Man, DNA, you are so fucking hood!
Im gonna rebuttal everything you say?
Goddamn it, I didnt even know I was that good
Shit, but fuck it, since he wants to talk about time
Then well talk about time, when I roll up outside and hurt ya
But youre DNA, you never click-clack the burner
You never commit the murder
See, I do what I want with the time limits
Ill just extend them further: this worlds mine, I control time
Thats why they call me the Prince of Persia
But you wanna rebuttal too
I mean, you rebuttald your missing tooth
But thats not even a rebuttal topic
I mean, you wanna rebuttal a missing tooth
Then make a CD, put out some music, get some money off it
Wait til at least you have one deposit
Go to your fucking dentist office
Write him a cheque with a fucking number on it
And if it makes you feel any better about the situation
You can write the word rebuttal on it
Homie, listen, its been since day one I aint liking you, dude
We can go outside right now and Im fighting you too
It aint about punchlines, DNA
Ill just display how Im a better writer than you
So stop talkin, pay homage, Im spittin
I solve problems, Im an awesome magician
This street magic, Ill make your beef vanish
Like hot pockets, ‘cause all of you chicken
I wanna squab with him, but if your squad is honestly trippin
That car stoppin, that Glock poppin
Your top open like Top Ramen before you spark the ignition
I start boxin, Bernard Hopkins
Your heart stoppin, Chris Farley condition
Theres no where to runin an arm bar, caught in submisison
Now you lost in the mix, got a bunch of hostages with him
He tried hoppin the fence, its an impossible mission
Im camouflaged in the trenches
Ready to penetrate your armys defences
With these binocular lenses I have a prophets vision
Is that the hardest kid in your clique? I got a problem with it
‘Cause Im the motherfucker, Im what your role model isnt
Im the armed technician here to remodel your kitchen
With a bomb in it, the islamic edition
Part of your crib gone with the wind, shards of you missin
Carvin your rib, disarm the opposition
Then plant the pipe bomb in the car engine
And have Queen Latifah set it off from the distance
My job description: I split wigs like a salon beautician
That .38 is Special like your moms condition
I know yall have a problem with the retard jokes
But I only use them ‘cause he has something in common with them
‘Cause when he says hes flippin to mingle
And hes letting the machete spray
Its not hard for us to see the retarded in him
I dont give a fuck if yall wanna donate to autism
The truth is — cover your ears, Bishop — the truth is your moms not even a good example of what being handicappeds about
‘Cause shes a master at that wheelchair
In that I wouldnt have a doubt
Most people, getting around when theyre disabled
They find it hard, and you live in a massive house
But she uses the fucking hallways as interstate freeways
Where she gets off at the nearest living room exit
So she can take the fastest route
Weaving in and out of furniture traffic
She doesnt even scratch the couch
But shes kinda like you in a sense, ‘cause whenever shes stuck in a corner shes really good at backing out
Stop touching me! Yall gon make a rapping discovery
I dont even know how I can battle you so comfortably
I still cant even believe this faggots in front of me
Everyday I wake up and I hit a blunt before I even wash my face up
Then I think about your genetic make-up
And how we can make up such a fake fuck
You pussy you duck hunt  youre getting duct-taped up
Ill kill every faggot in your city, Ill even fuck Mase up
Theres nowhere to run now, youre on a one-way truck
About to get ran the fuck over over by a fucking one-way truck
You little fucking pussy! Your face is vaginal
Your mouth is like a vagina and in the center it has a hole
But fuck a camel though, you have enamel toe
Its Dizaster, you know I act like a crude jerk
Your attitude is past faggot, dude
You got a gap in your tooth, gagged and you yapped on your new shirt in your battle with Tsu Surf
I react, Im rollin fast, I let the tool burst
Kids will get hit in ass like the back of a Vatican school church
I take stacks off packages, this faggot dont move work
The only cleaning his gap out
Is the only time he digs up or actually do dirt
Two thirds of his life has been a root canal
Conceited influenced you in style
Everything you about to do he happened to do first
Your foundation is missing
Like the roof of your mouth, that is what you worth
I would slap this dude around
But the fact is life is already battling you worse
And that is reality, I know its sad, but the tooth hurts
Diz, you aint say one thing hot
You still aint say the fuckin truth; Ive been in about 18 battles
And he still gone mention my fuckin tooth
And yall gone cheer ‘cause you think its nice, people
But thats wack, ‘cause its shit likes to go to the gap
Like white people — so why you gon keep freestylin
Actin like you gettin it? Diz, you aint rippin it
Even your hat knows Im gonna win
‘Cause its like Cleveland, you gone lose in the end
Then you wanted to mention my mom being disabled
Thats why I hate that you rap, b
You just placed in your rap, D
My teeth is missing and I got a face full of acne
When that steel flare
I bet all of these fans will cheer, like Drake in Degrassi
People are rappin, you must be kiddin me
Ill do you like Pun, have you dead in the middle of little Italy
Thinkin you can spit with me, you aint hot as humidity
So why would yall give him props
For mention my mom with a disability?
Ill go to your moms house, come through, smack her hard
Come through, see her right quick, then I snatch that broad
Catch her right in the kitchen while shes eatin caviar
And put that bitch in a wheelchair out the blue like the Avatar
And this the point, see somethin somethin
You think that you so nice, you little old clown
You rebuttal half lines, I damn near just rebuttal your whole round
This the point where I pin you down and have Organik hold you
Beat the shit outta you like your pops did when he disowned you
Give you the same treatment
That you did every time you was disloyal
But wait, before I do all that, Ima expose you
Remember what you told Organik about King of the Dot?
Your league is fucking shitty, bro
If you aint gonna give us the help in promotion and gettin dough
Then why the fuck you attach our logos
Against your bitch-ass videos?
Fuck King of the Dot! We technically invented you
GrindTimes the prototype, we do what you pretend to do
I will never respect this chump!
Now you over here two years later? I guess time flies loud
‘Cause if you aint notice
King of the Dot is shittin on Grind Time Now
And your last three battles been in Canada
So this league basically made you, bitch!
And you disrespected them in a battle? You ungrateful bitch!
You a faggot, Im just tryna figure out what made you switch
I guess Grind Time held you down and then raped you, bitch!
I couldnt wait to get in your face to tell you I hate you, bitch!
Flew all the way Canada
To put you in a wheelchair: Drake you, bitch!
They said DNA fell off, well, now Im back — thank you, bitch!
But hows his pop rich and you say you struggle, dummy?
You take battles for free but gotta pay bills?
I guess you dont care about no fuckin money
For a couple of pennies hell be ready to travel
So it makes sense when you ate that sandwich versus SMP
‘Cause thats the only time you had bread in a battle
Then you disrespected Jin and his whole race
But I bet you if you seen him youd probably switch sides
And dick ride and be pole-dancin
You whine and cry about every battle, I bet you have a fit
That you dont get your way at your folks mansion
So it makes sense why you hate Asians
‘Cause you always throw tantrums
And everybody knows that battle versus Locksmith
That one counted, ‘cause you showed you hated Asians more
‘Cause when you choked you looked dumbfounded
But if thats too low, then turn the volume on your speakers up
Your rhymes is weak as fuck
Like the last time Redman and Method Man tried teamin up.
And when he said that line versus Swave
At first I was like, Woooh, damn, thats hot!
Until Method Man co-signed you
And you just disrespected a legend who gave you props
And then if you talkin like that, then of course hes frontin
There aint a course, I get him off for nothin
This battles six days after Halloween
Its ironic, ‘cause he already lost to Pumpkin
And he said, In the MC book, when you fuck up you keep goin.
And in the eyebrow book, you keep shavin if they keep growin
‘Cause Ima keep it a hundred
My tooths missin and them eyebrows is real bushy
So King of the Dot, lets keep it a hundred
One of us is lyin sayin we get pussy
When I run up on Dizaster in New York with a Knicks hoodie
Hell back down and get scared and get mushy
Okay, I lied, I see one of us does get pussy
But why do you keep on talkin
When you act like you know you off the heat?
Me, right now? Nigga please! Im off the beat
Ill take your body off the concrete and throw it off the street
You got that dog chain on right now
But Im the one thats off the leash
So why you keep rappin like you be rappin when its dope
You a faggot, Ill clap it, then jack it like your coat
You told Swave you pop the 9, show him like Columbine
You think that you, Blood? Stop it, five!
They brought this yellow tape here
‘Cause Organik knew it was a homicide
So dont act like your raps is hot or youll blast the Glock
Times about to run out, you can have your knot
You have a problem with time
So you dont know how to stop on time when your raps is hot
But this Caliente will make you die before the aftershock
You dissed me about the Canada shit tryin to snatch my props
I think its funny how you have to mention Caliente and Aftershock
So you can ride King of the Dots cock
Thats how you fuckin get around, homie, Ill stomp you
The only reason you mentioned Drake in Degrassi
Because he reminds you of your mom too
Im basically nasty
Theres a couple of questions my fans have been waiting to ask me
Does she really look like Drake from Degrassi?
Is Cortez really on the sideline raking the grass leaves?
You fucking... you wanna get paid more guap now
You wanna get paid like an athlete
But youre on lockout, ‘cause you stay in a rap league
That only caters to Maths needs
When you left your GrindTime family you disappointed them
You made them regret the fact they ever let you join with them
No one forced you off the boat, bitch, it was your choice to swim
Now the only thing youll ever ever have in common with Poison Pen is the fact that youll never be boys again
You know what else rhymes with Poison Pen?
Umm, I dont know, backstabbing disloyal friend?
When you say bars over jokes, why you gon pretend?
You dont truly believe bars are better than jokes
Youre not keeping it a hundred and ten
‘Cause you switch it up to comedy too
I always hear laughter when your punches come to an end
Especially when you spit your gun bars
We all think youre the funniest then
I mean come on, dawg, you really cant fuckin rap with me
I can go off the fuckin top
And this whole thing will become a tragedy
Yeah, motherfucker, you aint wanna be the man right now
You fuckin cant even see me, you cant even stand right now
But I take care of my shit and I can fuckin kill you all
Yeah, you little fuckin pussy, I dont feel you all
But since Ima change up on this topic ‘cause Ima kill it tonight
Ima touch up on a topic about why you lie
And everybodys gonna feel it, aight?
This is a topic I wasnt gonna illustrate tonight
I think most of the time your brains wouldnt be able to comply
But I figured yall smarter generation are educated
And figured I wouldnt be afraid to try
See, mainstream science is a bunch of manipulation in disguise
They blindfold you from the real truth
To distract you from a database they hide
Charles Darwin is a faggot who thinks we came from evolution
And later on we changed in size in a different phase in time
What Im tryin to say to you is
Why would you believe in that and the Bible?
Those are all fairy tales, goodbye
‘Cause the truth of our genetics is written in the ancient scribe
Our bloodline was given to us from aliens
That came from spaceships in the sky
Now youre wondering why Im saying this
Its ‘cause based on his name I can relate it to this guy
Its all reality based, all in this equation still applies
‘Cause based on reality
Everything ever said that was about DNA has been a lie
Im embarrassin yall lames
Im evisceratin your jaw and Im tearin your small frame
Rippin your fuckin heart out and leavin it there in the car lane
You st-st-stuttered when you tried to mention that dog chain
You stupid fuck! You have terrible blog game
Yeah, motherfucker, the true stories youre supposedly telling
Theyre lies and theyre basically all lame
DNA hears a story one way
When it comes out of his mouth it apparently got changed
So youre not DNA, they gave you the wrong name
You should change your name into the American Arcane
DNA! Yo, Im DNA! Hold on! Hold on!
Now Ima roll up and Ima come with the 5s and the 6 and the 7s
Now when I go from 8, 9 and 10,t hatll mean you get hit with 11
Thats what you sound like: A, B, C, D, E, F, G
Its always the same thing: if I bodied Rone and Rone bodied Okwerdz, then what does that make me?
Shut the fuck up! Alright?
Youre just an undercard to the main star actors
What you gonna do now that Smack dont wanna pay off none of these maincard rappers?
What you gonna do now, huh?
Do like you did in Oun P and spit your little gay bars backwards?
What you gonna do?
Race me in a race track in a race car backwards?
What you gonna do? Come with the metal after you summon the devil from listening to a Lil Wayne song backwards?
What you gonna do? You wanna play that stupid little fuckin game, then game on, faggot
Ill leave your little brain all trapped
Inside one of your own little gay 8-bar patterns
Like, go ahead, DNA, flip the word radar backwards!
Hold on! Hold on! I can do it, hold on!
So when I roll up with the AR and I spray off clappers
Thatll be the result of this battle
If you spell the word radar backwards
Wait a minute, radar… thats still the same bar backwards!
Hold on, hold on! Now when I roll up with the 
And I spray off clappers
Thatll be the result of this battle if you spell the word radar backwards… goddamn it, its still radar backwards!
Truth is, Ill break it down for yall
Since your boy Cortez, a.k.a. Jose, wont explain this stuff
I was on the cell all day tryin to set up this whole thang with Lush
While you in the background with him
Doing roleplay on the phone hangin up
You think playin with my money is funny, Ill blow this location up
And I wont leave until I make sure your face gets crushed
Add more flame, I turn your torso and face to dust
More flame, the propane take your soul, raise it up
Ill leave you fuckin clothes in your skull breakin up
And dislocatin your shoulder bone from your rotator cuff
You smile like you dont use Colgate enough
Every couple of seconds when youre rappin
Your nose face gets touched
Like your tryin to point the way your cocaine is stuck
Or your just another faggot actor
Who thinks hes soulmates with Lux
But Lux is the man… Syke, youre both gay as fuck!
Ill rip Hollows hand off
While its still attached to his foam paper cup
It was, like, six in the morning
I saw you and your little sister Jennifer Cortez sit on the corner
Holdin up a sign that said For food were willing to sit on a boner
Polish a ball sack and suck dick for a quarter.
And underneath it said Please! All we had for dinner was yoghurt.
Your little Smack gimmick image here literally wont work
I bet Math used to punk you and make you finish his homework
This kid is like Conceited
Except he ended up hitting his growth spurt
Your boy Murder Ave doesnt even exist, its not even a known turf
You guys are both nomads
The only home this ho has is literally his own shirt
Look at you rubbin yourself tryin to keep your composure
You ran away fuckin Smack
Because the events they had were bigger and doper
Always bitchin that Grind Time couldnt give you exposure
So you walked around for like six months
With a chip on your shoulder, before you decided to jump ship
Hoping to get you a little bit closer
But swiffed out on our interest
‘Cause you were the diva that was tippin it over
And the sad part is all Smack had to do to bribe you
Was promise to put some rims on your stroller
They offered Cortez a new fisherman boat
So he doesnt have to swim to the border
And Hollow Da Don got a brand new Nintendo controller
People always said your boy Cortez looked like Pitbull
And even though hes the same identical poser
Now I believe hes a pitbull
Since I seen him switch up on his owners
Listen here, bitch, you have a listening disorder
Your mission is officially over
If you think you gon beat me Id rather hire Jin as my chauffeur
Yeah, Im a F15 engine versus a 1960 Corolla
And youre missin your motor
Ill run up in your crib with them soldiers while youre sippin a soda
Catch you slippin, put you in submission and fold ya
Then jump up and put my kicks on your sofa
Like Tom Cruise did to Oprah
Yeah, whats going on, pussy?
It looks like that type of shit you cannot respond to
You said on the track 1.25 seconds on your song
About your dad gone that you never clapped a revolver
Yeah, remember? One minute, 25 seconds
You looked up to the light and screamed out
Ive never touched a drug or busted a gun in my life!
You never clapped a revolver, Ill flat-line you
Snipe at your heart like the final boss you battle in Contra
So act like Manic, so act like Manic, Ill pop ya
Give me that deadly stare, Ill let it air
Leaving shells everywhere like Italian pasta
You roll with a pack of imposters
You dont wanna scrap, Ill pull a MAC and Ill sock ya
Get bitch slapped with the impact of A-Class crashin his Honda
Ill strike you faster than the Black African Mamba
And send your body bag back to Rwanda
Battling me is worse off than sharing a bath tub with Blanka
Or getting a back rub massage from Mortal Kombats Baraka
Your breath smells like asshole and cacka
You need to grab some Binaca
Ill backhand you and I will damage your chakra
The day you beat me is the day everyone in Canada considers Sno an actual Rasta
What you know about weed?
Your whole life you probably only seen two bags of ganja
Im a YouTube superstar, everyday I have new fans
From Deutchland to Jakarta, from Buktan to Combala
Dominican Republic, and Yucads in Cabanas
Kuala lumpur and Sri Lanka down to Sudan and Uganda
But all you have is two fans: youre Kitana
I saw you wearing earrings that one day, fake-ass shits
Put on, probably put on, start wearing Prada
Instead of fucking worrying about what you wear
You should try and display some honour
You scared to come to California
Afraid Ill put them Grapes gangstas on ya
But every time you rap its about how you bang your llamas
And how you give my brain caps and you be making trauma
And how your homies rolled around Vegas
And shut the whole baby down and start creating drama
But that doesnt make you crazy
That makes you like QPs baby mama
You never shot a gun in your life, like you said
Yeah, and thats the reason why Im having major problems
With the way you were brought up
But it aint your fault, thats why I blame Madonna
Come on, dawg, lets kick some facts and just be honest, huh?
You went to Smack, put up a stack and you peed on it
And that is a fact, I aint gotta actually speak on it
Far as your Facebook statuses, the average is three comments
You leave today with a stash in your jeans pocket
Then Im smackin that green off it
You went to Smack, got jacked for your bread and didnt demolish youre average at best
And to add to that threat this MCs polished
Fuck what this faggot just said, I rapidly clap with that lead
And rip a patch up the back of your head like Rasheed Wallace
Your moms fucking retarded, I mean it!
But its not the same, ‘cause shes also a genius
She gives a lot of brain: shes a quadriplegic
I dont give a fuck about her eating problems
She can exercise some different feeding options
She cant use her hands, they shake
So if she wants to have some steak, she puts the knife between her toes and uses her retarded feet to chop them
But no matter how good she gets at holding the silverware
She always seems to drop them
And then stands back looking at em
Like, If only I had longer reach like Dhalsim.
But I dont want no beef, your moms a G from Compton
Any moment she might show up at King of the Dot
And get them heaters poppin
So I better flee before she acts like Stephen and brings the hawk in
You rapped about your dad in the beginning
Thats some shit I wasnt gonna say
But Im an evil motherfucker, so all that shit you were talking about, I think that shit is gay
Yeah, I will fly him out of his casket and Ill slump the faggot
Ill fuck your mom in front of her and Ill soak the mattress
Then Ill throw the broken prophylactic on his open casket
I will forge a stack of boarding passes
Get on board a Concorde and crash it
Into an overpass during morning traffic
Who said that? Come on! Admit it, homie! Speak up, brother!
Ill go back there right now and Ill fuck your mother!
Callin fuckin Organik like he fuckin owes you somethin
Motherfucker doesnt owe you nothin
‘Cause you dont know nothin about strugglin
Look at The Saurus and Illmac, yeah, look at The Saurus, cousin
Theyre battling for pride
If they lose today theyre going home with nothin
But youre too much of a pussy, a battle you wont go judgin
Youd rather be a fuckin homo and just vote on public
Yo, who the fuck is talking, bro? Yo, whos talking?
Aight, I see youre offended because his mom is being brought up
Okay, that shit is some harsh stuff
But this is battling, what do you expect?
This is the type of shit that pops up
What? What?! Yall fuckin mad his mom is brought up?
I dont give a fuck if they have special needs
They got all types of foundations to get their guap up
I dont know about yall, but
Ive already donated enough money from my heart into that large cup sitting at the counter in every single Starbucks
Fuck you! Dont ever fuck up my battle!
Ill pick up your bitch and Ill hump her like my camel
Did anybody see who he was talking to?
No! Me neither, so whyd yall think that was hot, yall?
‘Cause you looked up there for five seconds
And talked to something unknown, like a blocked call
So, Diz, why do you think you getting hot
And, like, you gon grip a round?
Me, DNA, Im in Canada my first time, Ill rip the town
Show you how Im the illest
And Im the realest with the sickest sound
He kept mentioning Hollow, but its like his battle with Hitman
‘Cause when I pull it out I wont miss the pound
See, if yall really think about that
Now Im gonna try to stay calm and keep my cool, b
But Ive been watching King of the Dot battles
And I saw a dude that had potential we would soon see
And I dont like bringing up people that died usually
But truthfully, this faggot shouldve died instead of Bruce B
Youre not a shot buster, at Blockbuster you wouldnt move E
You dick ride and switch sides, you a groupie
I dont know that much about Canadian change
But I tell yall truthfully
I know for a two dollar coin hell be on his two knees
So, Diz, why would you even start though?
You act like you gangsta and you tough
Like you got the heart though
You a bitch, Ill have more whips at your house than a car show
Smoke him down, just like a Marlboro, never at heart though
Since he think he street in Canada
If its war, then Ill mark him and leave his face with a scar, bro
Dizaster, I have a question: why do you rap like this?
You spit no punchlines, but do all of this
Why do you act like this?
See, you wanna act crazy, like, you could stop with this
This isnt a battle of battling
This is a battle of Dizaster battling Alcoholic Anonymous
Hes standing here in front of Organik
Thinking that hes the rapping answer
And I bet you wish you can get a disease
So you can battle cancer
You think youre so nice so you can rap for weeks
Dizaster has insomnia on purpose, so he can battle sleep
I bet your grandmas 97
And listens to Arab Money to get her party off
You make bombs so much you wake up to car alarms
If your mans name was Puff Daddy
Then youd suck off Sean and John
I show up to your moms house
With pepperoni on a Papa Johns
And take it back when she opens it and tell her its ramadan
So, nigga, why you acting tight?
I heard they sling out here in Canada
I seen today you stayed calm, you aint vexed
But how the hell you ever expect to be the King of the Dot?
Nigga, you aint Rex
See, yall dont get how I can switch that, nigga, when hes next
I broke that down, King of the Dot, Dot Mobb, T-Rex
Oh, see, yall might not get that with that bar
Matter of fact, uhhh—that was okay when I make rhymes
But I bet you get the bar
When I let off this gun and let that K shine
Ran into his crib when I set you off with that burner shoot
And after that you get murdered
And murdered even worse just like Murder Mook
So why you keep talkin like you the best, cuz
Now Ima get on some other shit
Disconnect your body, they wont find where your head was
Now they over there with the morgue
The doctors dont know where your leg was
Your family come and try to see you in the morgue
And they dont know where his head was
Now, you looking, hes just a John Doe
So when his DJ goes to make a best of…, they gon have to put a question mark in front of his name, like ?uestlove
Now we here in this battle, Diz, so say what you say now
If you act up, then come through, Ill let off that tre pound
Why talk about a gun
When I got dawgs on each side, like Greyhound?
Beat you up to the part til you cant even stay now
You wont have a future, like that nigga from 8 Mile
Run around with the sixty
And leave your body on the playground
Theyll be nothing but your soul left, just like James Brown
Pick him up, snuff him
And watch me spin money online, like PayPal
And he still gonna try to rhyme
‘Cause he gon act like hes better
Dizaster, you think you so tough with these bars
But I really dont think you better
You can never come through and act like you fresher
I found out that his signs a crab
Which means that hes a cancer
And that explains why you always crack under pressure
So, Diz, why you gon act like you goin when its hot?
How can you respect the nigga
That disrespect the dude for making a song for his pops?
But he gon act crazy like he fear harder
But since you mentioned my dad, you reminded me of him
‘Cause after this, yall wont see your career goin farther
So why you wanna act like you step beat fast?
Nigga, I pop and leave, like dead beat dads
And then he wants to talk crazy
Like you come through and smash your men
If I could do this then, Dizaster, wed fight
And Id beat up this fag again
I heard Hollohans in jail, thats all cool
I wish he could be here to rap again
But if yall all know the Bible the only way God can come back is when the disaster end
So how you think you dumb funny?
How you just say I was scared to battle for three stacks
But then you came at Drake? Thats why you got young money
And you never have cash when you grippin it hard
So, nigga, Ill blow your brains off, then blow your other brains off, then blow your other brains off
And keep changing wigs, like Nicki Minaj
It doesnt make sense, Diz?
So why you think that you straight hotter?
If I dont know what Im saying when I dont make sense
Well, nigga, you dont make dollars
You never had money in the rows when know Im getting silly
If this dont make sense
Then how come we only battled for $750?
Now come through when you act like you crazy
And you fuck with that; tell the truth, Diz
We couldve battled on Smack for double that
But you tried to do it here at King of the Dot
And I said, Thats cool, I plan it.
‘Cause you never get nothin, you never act up and blam it
Youre a waste of a nut
You shouldnt even belong on this planet
And, truthfully, you shouldve got fucked up
By the cops instead of Organik
So why you keep acting like you so tough
Like you can spray shells?
Aw, youre yawning while Im rappin
Thats all cool til I spray well
You think that I cant do what you do
I can do it better when I Raylell 
Just think of this battle with the L.A. initials backwards
‘Cause thats what hes leaving with: a L
See, Diz, you wanna keep rappin crazy
When you try to act like you flow like best
But you cant come through, nigga, I put a hole like chest
Now I aint even come through to rap with it
Ima show him how Smack and quick
Gon dap this bitch after that I clap the clip
He keep movin his head back until I smack it quick
You a faggot that I never come through and dap you, bitch!
Ill run up in your crib, real too, and smack it quick
And shoot him while hes writing with his pen
Now thats how you air a bic 
And that was a half punchline, that aint even the half of it
Now Ima switch up and talk to this nigga in Arabic
Hedat, your family told me youre a maniak
Theres a thousand words in the Arab dictionary
But my favorite one is Eddifat
Ella Stasi, ‘cause these dudes wanna keep talking with the clip
But after that Im like Pulla Misha Marka!
‘Cause that means youre a bitch
And after that Ima say Its getting hot in here.
And Ik Fala Watchi! Yall know what that means in Arabic
Get him the fuck outta here!
So why this dude acting up like he playing with me?
Oh, you thought we was in Canada
So they wouldnt say it with me?
Nigga, please! Why you play inside?
That slogan is like Boost Mobile, that shits nationwide
So why you acting crazy with the best shell
These clips will make you sprint
And find your body in the next tell 
Why you keep talking like you bet for sure?
Oh, you know about the hotels we in?
You on the 6th and Im on the 7th floor
Thats cool, nigga, so stay up
After I blast with the shell, I hate to leave him on the elevator
‘Cause hell be going on his way up
So you keep rhyming, Diz
Keep spitting all these bars when I clap ya
Acting all hard, but see, you not a real dude, you just a actor
It doesnt matter what you say
‘Cause youre gay and you just a actor
You cant do what you do ‘cause, nigga please, Im the pastor
Break you down crumble youre body like Ritz crackers
‘Cause I got a question yall: whats a disaster to a rapture?
He cant move it on that blink screen
You so stupid you cant do what the blinks, D
I kill him in fucking 7HD, a HD, come through
Turn his body soul, rip it apart and have it lookin like gangrene
Fuck up your soul, have your body lookin like brinkscreen 
Ima teach your old teacher stupid I make greenery
So after I do that when I spark fiends
Shoot him in his pockets with money
And you gon see that wall green
And after I do that on a nice day, hit him with that nice tre
Then doctors and paramedics
Gon be having to find the right aid
‘Cause Ill run up on that whip, when Im steerin now
I see that hes fearin now, I clear the town
Bishop Brigante ratchets
I shoot it in your face and tear that mirror down
You clear the town when Im offin the dome
‘Cause right now, please nigga, frees, top of the dome
I come through—fuck that!
Like you said you always talk about poppin the shone 
But after I shoot Ima have to off his top, like Charron
And he keep thinking he coming praisin when you on that
You acting like you can freestyle
And rhyme, nigga, like you move on that
You say that you like rhyming nerdy
But I dont get it when you cool on raps
‘Cause every battle you have with a street rapper
You talk about guns like you on Smack
So, Diz, how does that make sense, when its so lovely?
You said that you didnt shit on King of the Dot
And now its so lovely
Now you gon try here get in my face and try to punk me
So lets break it down
On exactly what he said about this country
Nigga, who are you airin?
You just stand six feet tall and didnt do shit
Nigga, who are you scarin?
Like, whats wrong with this dude?
I had to tell him five times and maybe one time?
Like, we know, you know, we both freestylers
So why would you do that? So I can make a punchline?
Like, I dont get it when I blam it
Now back to what I was talking bout with Organik
Like I said, right? This dude gon act like hes on his grown shit
When I mentioned King of the Dot, you shouldve said something, but since you didnt Ima rebuttal your own shit
Like when I said you disrespected King of the Dot
And that was lovely, then you shouldve replied
Well, then Organik disrespected our country
And thats when I wouldve told you
Im disrepectful for spittin in your face
But I got more respect for Organik
‘Cause at least he did it in our face
And you pussy, you never hold the 9 and spray
Like when you said Canadians are faggots!
Canadians are faggots!—you did that shit miles away
So now that we here in Canada
And you said they have no military, they have no healthcare
And Canadians are faggots—say it again, Diz!
No, say it again, Diz, about Canada!
Diz, whats going on here? Things startin to change
You see youre on your way now
You heard all them boos, you kinda looking like me on 8 Mile
But now he acting crazy when hes poppin it nice
You tried to talk about me with Eminem droppin the mic
But you think its all cool, somethin somethin, the best in?
Well, you just booed in front of the same presence
In front of a worldwide legend
So, like I said, say Canadians are faggots again!
Repeat that! Exactly my point
He aint do it this time, because, to me, I mean that
So why he keep acting crazy?
Acting like he all tough blammin a razor
I just came to King of the Dot

Yeah
Yeah-eah-eah, yeah-eah-eah
Yeah
Yeah-eah-eah, yeah-eah-eah
First time I saw you, I wasnt thinking of you and I
I was just thinking of I
First time we fucked was at my place, it was a couple years late
But it was fate and I think you feel good about it
So now we end up in this place we both hate
And I think it takes a sacrifice
Not fair, its not right, its impractical
For you to leave that man and come and just be mine
Try, you wont even try
Its simple, its simple

My name is Drizzy, and I aint perfect
But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Aint on the fence about it, I aint Mr. Feeny
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and Im the one thatll feed it
But truly youre bad enough that yall dont even really need it
You could show up at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin candids
Of you and your posse partyin, drinkin what you get handed
With your Virgin Island tans, all lookin like you just landed
I dont really understand it, Im not sure Im comprehendin
But these girls are having fun with whoevers money they spendin, screamin
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you dont lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you dont lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you dont lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you dont lie
Ahem, my name is Weezy, Im almost perfect
And I work harder than hard workin
Bizarre circus, thats when my bars surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when Im layin on my back Im never backin down
So over-stand me
I got a condo in Miami and my doormat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana, but Ive never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandana
And when it comes down to stuntin, you boys are just buntin
And Im swingin for the fence, your girl hangin from my dick
Your girl singin to my shit, like, a-la-la-lollipop
She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop
And she say I freak that pussy better
Better than her gynecologist, ho just
Text me whenever you want some more dick
More dick, old bitch, young bitch
But I be like damn, all I got is one dick
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you dont lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you dont lie
I got the talk, the beat and bass
Give me one, Ill take it, make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play so I speed up the pace
I break it, break it you cant stop me in this ra-race
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you dont lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you dont lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you dont lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you dont lie

And I got verses, I got verses
My sixteens should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied, you see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses

If I put it in a verse, then I put it on my life
Liquor thats over ice and denim thats overpriced
And tryna make all my goals for the future come overnight

Im tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over, watch a season of Flight of the Conchords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours

Yes, I swear to God, girl I put it on Lord

The tide is high, nothings lost
Could turn over a new leaf, for my love, oh

You are afraid to be fully open
Though you can see all my cards
My heart is in overdrive
My heart is racing
I cannot slow down and its bothering me
How forward of me would it be to tell you to forward to me
You should be right here anyways
Your energys calling for me
Theres deeper places we can go
Dont have to just party with me
I hope we can make it
I hope we can make it
I hope we can make it, oh, oh

I dont do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
These days
Ive met some women
I wish I had resisted these days
These days
These days I seem to think
About how I have failed
To change all of my ways
These days
Yeah, I had a lover
Dont think Id risk another
These days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
Just listen to the life Ive made in songs
These days
Ive stopped the dreaming
I dont do too much scheming
These days
These days
I sit inside a chauffeur car
With windows down and count the stars
These days

Yeah

Toast up man
Yeah, okay, yeah
Goldman Sachs, they wanna hold my racks
Hedge fund investors talk to Adel like he the expert
I hear it in they tone when they address him
We way too connected
Tom Ford assistant texted asking if I want classic or double breasted
I flex with broad shoulders
When I walk through the halls they move over
Stories of how we handle ours start to travel like a lone soldier
I told you
You hold your girl the same way that I hold composure
Or hold the wheel of the Fuji white Rover
Silverstein dinners, all kosher
Never rushin
My niggas really made somethin from nothin
Dodge sentences like they dont wanna discuss it, change subject
Got the Benny Yang chains rubbin, never tucked in
Waiting to inhale
Things that I own will sell at auction as proof we did well
My house museum-scale
The only skeletons here are the ones from the nights I raised hell
Make sure the staff are paid well
Make em think twice bout the stories that they tell
No one knows when the plan is hatchin
Ima let em walk on eggshells
Tiptoe, niggas better know
Wow, man like Drizzy Drake!

Im living next to Michael, Bobby, Ralph, Johnny
My neighbors soundin like New Edition
Thats these guys
Us guys dont wear New Balance or Levis
Key West retirement plan
Grippin the Callaway club in my hand
Hittin balls off of the balcony into the sand
Tryna see where they land
October Firm the new chain of command
El chico, this verse is the explanation for the large ego
100 mill hands free like Ronaldinho
I go from Star to Venetian in a small speedboat with girls we know
Take your pick, Brooke or Tanya
Both those shortiesd leave their GPS on so I can find ya
Drop location
Spring break trips, Im in hot rotation
I took a lot of my brothers from B and E licks or the pot rotation
To ridin shotgun in a Picasso painting
Tricks up sleeves, have em playin innocent to get the shits I need
Loyalty is priceless to me and this I see
Before I ever seen this shit tatted on P and tatted on C and tatted on me
I speak truth and get to shatterin dreams
So its best to tiptoe, niggas better know, yeah

Ugh! Too many women and not enough time
Im a cool cat, but Im on Life Nine
Pimping aint dead cause I be the lifeline
And I dont buy the bar cause it dont sell white wine
Go on, let that light shine, balling for a lifetime
Smoking on that nice pine, Weezy baby flight-flying
You can call him your husband, call me at nighttime
And even though women change, I will always like dimes
And yeah, Im quite fine, but shawty much finer
And I just get behind her and smack it like E. Honda
And please dont hate on me when you see me with Keyana
Cause she wilder than Nirvana and colder than your honor
Holler at your boy manana, Maybach come with a recliner
Run up on it and shit will get uglier than an iguana
This is only a reminder, its Young Money—dont forget it
And Im Weezy F. Baby, you might find it on her titty
Would you—
Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
Im in my Polo tee, Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
P—P—Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
Im in my Polo tee, Gu—Gucci sweatpants 
She on that jubilee, call me that ex-man 
Chilling with my posse, bout to call some ladies over 
Tell them this is YME, so when you come, you cant leave sober 
You would think she came with buttons by the way that I control her 
Put her on a tab, now she rolling like a baby stroller 
I’m the freshest niggas seen , weapon in my jeans 
Shoot your lights out, I’m like Redick with the beam 
Lifes a game of chess, and Im heading for your queen 
Not my stomach and my thighs, but her head is in between 
She wetter than a stream , I drink medicine to lean 
Keep a cup in my hand like Im begging for some cheese 
I fall off in the party , yeah, Im kinda tardy 
But if a hater trip, we ride on him like a Harley
Look, you call it getting married, I call it acting selfish 
My belt got Gs on it like a Packers helmet
And Ima hit it if you bring your girl around 
But the weed is like my collar , cause I might just turn it down if you—
Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
Im in my Polo tee, Gucci sweatpants

Okay, tool on deck , Im newborn fresh 
I knock your friends down , and you going next 
Young—Young Money, fly nigga, all the bitches after me 
Murder in the bed, and you gon be my next casualty 
Automatic stick, but I give it to her manually
Im giving dick out year-round, and you can get it annually
Styrofoam filled with a strawberry Fanta treat
Leaning—Ima need a kickstand to stay on my feet
Get out my business, like I kicks you out my office
I aint worried bout the price; Im more concerned with the offer
Fresh to death like I got dressed in a coffin
With a party in my pocket, blue and red dolphins
Im high as a motherfucker, let me do my thing, bitch
Im doing me, and your girl doing the same shit
Im in the car, getting head as I lane-switch
D—Double G: I do my thing, bitch! Now, you could—
Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
Im in my Polo tee, Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
P—P—Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
Im in my Polo tee, Gu—Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me that ex-man
Ugh, kay, I told you, Catch up—did you make a mil yet?
I cant predict how many of them I can still get
Octobers Own is such a fucking real set
No tats, but the ink on my money still wet
Life is such a beach; its sandy all around me
I came here with Young Money, man, thats family all around me
Im in my living room, and I got Grammys all around me
And famous bitches doing nose candy all around me
Welcome to the life, the life thats meant for me
My Bentley has a tint, and so you got to squint to see
I hollered at your girl; thats when she went with me
But please dont blame yourself, cause it just wasnt meant to be
They say Im one of the illest; thats just off a first impression
And my cards always accepted, I dont deal well with rejection
I look in the dictionary and dont see the word recession
I dont smoke in public, but tonight, Ill make an exception, so just—
Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
Im in my Polo tee, Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
P—P—Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
Im in my Polo tee, Gu—Gucci sweatpants

This the record that my backpack underground fans get to skippin
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin
Chasin fat stacks, runnin down grands and submission
I dont back track, every single sound for me different
I dont own no ice, I just got clean rap
I dont ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody Im standin besides all bossed up
Burglar minded they say Im servin them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
Im like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, when I get fed up, it’s sped up
Riding through the streets, just reclining in my seat hoe
Uh, them city lights is looking brighter, its 3 a.m. in the morning An the pen is like a lighter
I’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams get At ‘em when I ignite her
Yup, soon as a couple plan a trip, you smell gasoline I’m burning All up and down the strip, strip
I done said it, I give you the unleaded, just tip me, if your tank Is empty come get me
Yo, the city is mine 
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E thats me
You know how the story goes

Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey heres a tip
Now-a-days its gettin cheaper to put 20s on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20s in the clip
And if you find em attractive and funny, thats when you dip, dip
And its a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And its nothing that I created on purpose
Theres people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to em
See me out and they never utter a word to em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
Imma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It aint a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This aint last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people dont get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin on me, I deport em, the city is mine boy
Yo, the city is mine 
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E thats me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make em wanna

Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it

After that, break it down

After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down

I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell its gon be a cold winter
I hit the defrost, I never turn the heat off
And still Im so chilly willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin callin and textin
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men
Tellin my ex-girl tryin to explain
How I am no good, so go with the next man, but dog
You dont know me, you dont know us
We go by the name of A-T-F, and any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare em humiliation
I know you in and out, nigga I am not playin
Just fall back, keep on Escapein and Alizein
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us, so you knock us, thats precisely what I mean
And dog, its forever clear, my money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
Its all in a days work, thats what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And whose Continental GT is outside
Showin them how monumental he be?
One wheel on the curb, ticket on the dash
Its like every fuckin summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan Im a commodity, none of them as hot as me
The industry standard, so I am what they gotta be
Cause Drakes syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Cant help it, I been brainwashed to kill em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin with glass all in your pendant
You aint livin, rapper, you never have been
You a has-been, a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey, you wit a liar
Im clearin the air, Im a humidifier
Im spittin fire, and gettin flyer
And what you plannin for this summer, I did it prior
Ive shattered shows in tattered clothes
Met status quos, this is the South
And I am, present when it matters most
The startins hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin brain aint bad girl, dont be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom, they always ask me, Is that a rose?
You mean Rose? Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless
Im in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown

Riding to the music, this is how we do it all night 
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, 
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music
Wouldve came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I cant it let it go
Whether thats right, I will never know
But here goes nothing
When Im alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch one that live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl that swallows whats on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause Im running out of space
Elroy Jetson: Im somewhere out in space
In my two-seater shes the one that I would take
Riding to the music, this is how we do it all night 
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, 
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music
Wouldve came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I cant it let it go
Whether thats right, I will never know
But here goes nothing
Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC, VVSs in the watch
Living fast where its all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it aint no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100
Riding to the music, this is how we do it all night 
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, 
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music
Wouldve came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I cant it let it go
Whether thats right, I will never know
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, but waited too long
But I wouldve came back, but I wouldve came back for you
Wouldve came back
Wouldve came -
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back
Wouldve came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I cant it let it go
Whether thats right, I will never know
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, but waited too long
But I wouldve came back, but I wouldve came back for you
Wouldve came back

Ayy
Now I gotta tell you how lucky I am
This shit could have went a hundred different ways on a thousand different days for real
Yeah, whoop, ayy
On my way to the boat like I aint just have on a coat when I landed
Owl branded
Perched at the edge of the branches
They dont wanna talk mansions, mine look like a campus
And Im all about my brothers like the niggas Im samplin
Ill leave you red-shirted like the twins from Kansas
Really livin my dreams I used to have in my aunts crib
Might throw a Rockefeller chain on in the Hamptons
This shit sound like Im parked in the alley by ransom
My uncle went bankrupt and he was the last hope
My faith started to dwindle cause that was the cash flow
My mom would never walk again, thats what the doc said
So much medication, I was worried shed drop dead
For real
And I was the good guy, my friends were the hotheads
Times when I thought I should of stuck with my old friends
I mightve been at the end of my rope on both ends
The kids I went to high school with got trust funds
But we had more fun, trust
Textin my promoter, homie beggin for one plus
Girls wrote me off, didnt think Id become much
Dinner and a movie all for nothin, thats tough love
Meanwhile, rappers from other cities is cuttin up
We aint had the means to really make it, we comin up
But local niggas actin like we made it and runnin up
My heart beatin fast cause I needed to toughen up
We needed to huddle up
I felt like we was doin all we could but it wasnt enough
Spent a year in Brampton with my girl, just cuddlin up
Til one of my niggas hit my phone like you want it or what?
And now, the sound is champion
The singles is dancin, the pills is Ambiens
The lightin is ambient
The housewives is outside the booth cause they cant be in
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh yeah, Im the fanciest
They said summer was canceled but I got plans and shit
Where my advances is?
Ladies, its June, July, where all the Cancers is?
Show me your hands and shit
Even if you aint a Cancer, throw up your hands to this
Cause most of yall cancerous
Michael B. Jordan call you right now, you answerin
Even if you got a man that love you, you scandalous
You gon take the chance and shit
You know that relationship is probably in shambles
And you know you a fan of his
Know if he gon bring you to Miami, you scramblin
And pack all your luggage, get on the plane and land in it
Yeah, Im just talkin outta pocket now, I know yall sick of me
I looked at the score and yall cant be countin the victories
Its still all love between us, despite all the history
Its still October forever, minus the trickery
Talk about a flip the switch challenge
Its been challengin for ten years
Cause niggas been out here switchin on me
And showin how much realer that some of they bitches can be
This shout goes out to Hov cause its him and then me

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin with some girls Ive never seen before
Cause ever since I left the city


And I know
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, dont wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, thats a sad story, yeah, real bad karma
Condo in Miami, sold that shit to Chalmers
I stay on the beach when I retire
I cant miss a game, I been on fire
Im thinkin money when I sleep now
Thats the only thing that get me geeked now
Someone got a problem every week now
Oh, now, they talkin beefs, now
Gotta make peace and stay a hunnid 
All my girls bad, times a hunnid 
And Im going hard, times a hunnid 
Im tryna see a hunnid, times a hunnid
For the guys, for the city and the gang
I might appear if you keep calling on my name
Put a curse up on you, things are getting strange
You aint lie when you told me that I changed
And I know
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, dont wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, thats a sad story, yeah, real bad karma
Aye, 2 A.M. with my departure
Jug out to Miami, flew in charter
Stay one hunnid, look at me Ive been in charge 
Oh, you know Im bout to sauce on you 
Suggest you lighten up, I might go dark on you 
Hey, pull up, pull up, skrt, vallet park on you
Ayy, King Kong, climbing up the charts on you
Oh, goddamn, say my life is full of drama
Hot boy, I feel like Dwayne Michael Carter
Life been good since I became a father
Thought you said a kid would make it harder
No-no-no, trust me it just made me smarter
I cut some niggas off, put some real ones on the roster
Never mix the real niggas with the impostors
Keep them niggas far from us, I say, Fuck em all 
I say, Fuck em all
I just checked all my accounts and my money sittin tall
Nigga, shut your fuckin mouth, aint no need to air you out
Niggas know what you about, heard you goin through a drought
Must be why you talkin down
Boy I know
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, dont wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, thats a sad story

I’m performing tonight you know that shit gone be packed
Pay me in advance and make sure that it’s exact
My ex girl’ll probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But fuck that though, this about me
They say my whole fan base is missing ID
But the young trendsetting musician I be
Got critics giving up the recognition I de-serve
Never bring your Mrs by me
I’m it I’m it call me Mr. IT
If I get one wish Ima wish to die free
They say gon head, ball like Ms. Arie and I do
The realest in my age group, no shit
SoHo, Cosmo, Balmain blow fish
Lets make a toast, tell your friends come closer
Drinks on me like a coaster
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner
Long awaited, hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
It’s about time that you made it
I was bumping your songs when nobody else played it
When I was up in Hot Beats in Atlanta steady giving daps
Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I can’t sign nothing til my lawyer get the facts and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And Mrs. Murray look at what my talent did
And what your business is
Its been a couple years
Guess it’s not about who you know
It’s just how you balance it
It’s always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you coming the hardest
Its how you start actin when nobody can reach you
My plan just hatched, happy easter
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner
Uhh, ok I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in your starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A lot of people sayin fuck me
Problem is they be telling everybody but me
But I always got a Starbucks verse
Being brewed too hot please please double cup me
They never gave me support like Chuck Ts
And I never trust a nigga saying trust me
Nick cannon and will never did it this ill
So you tell the house band don’t you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never giving up
You deserve the world, now gon live it up
Thanks to Uncle Steve, my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us
And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldn’t leave you out, you forever in my heart
Yeah, and in the name of Evelyn Sher
I’ll forever forgive anybody that never was there
For me, no other woman could ever compare
My angel, I hope heaven’s prepared for whenever you there
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario coming through your stereo
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motherfucking Mario
Yeah and Polo isn’t at my session
Mr.Anticipation keeping everybody guessing like
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won

Sometimes it feel like niggas you love the most be the one that brings you down
Just speakin from experience since I done been around
I remember shit was smooth, we was dreamin cap and gowns
The older niggas preached to us the shit that we see now
Some of your friends gon die, some of your friends gon live
Some of em go to jail for all the shit they did
Every year they solid, every year they straight
I was always solid, solid all the way, oh
The way this shit at stake, you couldnt wait your turn
Studied my position, really had to sit and learn
Reel up all my money, better pay me like Big Worm
Still, Im cleanin money like a nigga fraid of germs
Drippin, Im the flyest, you could never call me sherm
This Louis V on me cost me like nothin, I could burn
Life is so funny, like every day I see it turn
Misunderstood, dont understand, you could learn
I was born to be great
And I wont let nobody tell me I aint
And I cant stop, wont stop
And I, I, I, I
You need to be done, done, done, done
And think somethin over
You just need to chill and focus
Try to get your life in motion
Dont think that I need to
Gave you your position, you just gotta see it through
Tried to help some niggas, they aint want it, it was cool
Now they try to tell me that Im actin brand new
I was on my dick, in the pit, goin through all types of shit
Swear, my momma always told me, This the only life you get
Havin fun, goin dumb, cause we started off with nothin
I swear we was tryna catch an opp and put two in his bun
Try and run, are you dumb? Its a beam on every gun
Witnesses is dyin, man, I seen that when we come
I done seen a lot of niggas fold
Seen a lot of niggas change, niggas bold
Growin up, Im gettin old, start settin goals
Tryna make more money off my businesses and shows
And everybody gon hate, Im great, I know
Everybody can hate, Im great, I know
And Im just gettin wiser as you see the time go
Im just gettin wiser as you see the time go
And everybody can hate, Im great, I know
Everybody can hate, Im great, I know

Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang

MAC 10, Beretta for the cold weather
Her ex let her blow cheddar, she a go getter
Hoe, clothes fit her, Moetter, but her flow better
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Keep machine gun strapped in case a nigga wanna act up
Petite gun raps aint even strong enough to match us
Machine gun BLAT in case a nigga wanna act tough
Aint nothin like a bad bitch

Like Bruh Man from the 5th floor
I creep up in it, deep up in it til she tell a nigga, Its yours

Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it aint about who did it first
Its bout who did it right, niggas looking like Preach
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that its harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didnt have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I dont know whats getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You aint ever worried cause hes not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin with me mentally, I think its meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin boys
But you gotta understand when its yours
They dont really leave your ass with a mothafuckin choice, man
I just love when Im with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then

In the trenches every night, bitch, Im holdin guns
Hold me down or could you slow me down?

On black and white just cause Im gettin holy now?
Another reason Ima have to slow it down
Snakes in the grass, you know I had to blow em down
We at the club, all my niggas down to slide
Look for the bright lights, I aint really hard to find
We at the club, all my niggas down to slide
Look for the bright lights, I aint really hard to find, the Ruler

We might slide on a nigga inside this club, girl, close your eyes

We just cool, bro, you gettin too excited
Aint seen your face when I was up on that indictment
Aint get a letter, I was strugglin and fightin
With these peoples, they was demons
Tried to put me in a cage, was sayin, Free me
Now we on TV, drag racin at 8A
Rugrats in the car, we was Bebes
Ayy, baby, was your name on any JPays?
Got the audacity to talk to me crazy, you buggin
I dont know if what we have is love, but its on my mind
We might slide on a nigga inside this club, girl, close your eyes
Fifteen brothers, no friends when I pull up, for peace of mind

I be getting money so long
Its just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pinot grigio
Baby, forget about it
Im headed wherever this motherfucking jet is routed
You can’t have my heart the doctor told me I’d be dead without it
My judgments never cloudy
That’s why I’m steady yelling weatherman, weatherman
I’m about whatever man
I’m tryna fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland
But I’m polite about it
Baby, after you
I’ve had a glass or two so
Somebody remind me where I am
Thats right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they aint getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
Thats probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
Tryna get the green like I’m waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn’t suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where’d I put my bow tie
Millionaire, multi
Rest in peace to B.I.G. and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I’m the man now, I guess that parts a given
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask whats up and they just always say the cost of living
I learn from it though, I’ve been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love I dont think should happen
Cause everythings easier to get into than get out of
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I’m still the mafia, I still run the committee
N.Y. forever nigga, Diddy
Somebody remind me where I am
Thats right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they aint getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
Thats probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

Now when it come to makin money, Im a printing press 
And when it come to bein trill, Im the litmus test
Run it like a fitness test 
And when it come to making history, Im like Joes son 
A million ways to die and you already chose one 
A million dollars stacked, it sounds like a good beginning 
We on the top now
Go back and tell the hood we winning 
And while youre there, let em know I did it just for them 
I made em cough the cash up
And left em just the phlegm 
Is that the King of the Trill? Go tell em, Yes, its him 
And his testosterone is up, whos got the estrogen? 
I like your girl and I think she like me even more 
I hit her with that heave-and-ho and then Im leavin bro 
The Dirty Souths finest, and Dirty Souths behind us
Now, thats a plus on the report card, not a minus
Keep your security blankets because Im not your Linus
You got a problem with us? You know just the spot to find us
Ugh! Since youre telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, shell probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
They know Im in a Port Arthur state of mind
Southern superstar status , I elevate the grind 
My time is money, so I put some money on my time
Lightning on the Breitling
So exciting when you see the shine 
We on a level those before us never even thought of 
I broke my bread and fed my team just like the Holy Father 
I helped the blind to see and kept it G just like I oughta 
The only thing thats left for us to do is walk on water 
We playing all four quarters til the clock expire 
So til I see the ref waving, I will not retire 
My flow is still official, and I still got the fire 
Cant take your eyes off me 
Like when you watch The Wire 
And in oh-ten , we finna go in 
So let the opposition know that there is no win 
And I am no friend , so put your hand down 
And tell em, Stand down before its Man down 
Ugh! Since youre telling on me, tell the world about me

You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Round! I gotta hundred girls in each phone
Drizzy Drake, mayne—Young Sweet Jones
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on
I know you cant bring every single one you meet home
Homesick just when I thought I was sick of home
Losing track of time, every day, we switchin zones
Drizzy Hendrix, Im just backstage getting stoned
Thank Me Later, man, a million copies shipped and gone
Overboard, nigga; Im quoted more, nigga
Results are in, I guess you shouldve voted more, nigga
Swimming in the money, yall just float ashore, nigga
Never drowning, what the fuck you think this boat is for, nigga?
Yeah, Im quick to take a R&B diva out
I bring some friends
She bring some friends that know what we about
And when its done, I put my slippers on and see em out
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
I swear these women living like they tryna write a book after
But Im just really tryna keep it G for my chapter
Listen to my words, see just what I mean
Rest in peace to Chad Butler, every day Im riding clean, damn!
Ugh! Since youre telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, shell probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down

Baby, I think it might be too late, were too far gone
Chemistrys frozen, we feel disconnected and exposed
I cant remember, when last did we feel familiar?
Tell me youre ready, tell me youre ready to walk away
Overnight
Overnight, were done
Overnight
Overnight
Overnight, were done
Overnight
We tri-tri-tried, tried, tried
We tri-tri-tried
We tri-tri-tried, tried, tried
We tri-tri-tried
We tri-tri-tried, tried, tried, tried, tried, tried
Tri-tri-tried
I used to wonder how you could swear its for life
Constant confusion, nearing conclusion, going downhill
We spent last summer, we spent last summer so differently
I cant pretend, I cant pretend it was final
Overnight
Overnight, were done
Overnight
Overnight
Overnight, were done
Overnight
We tri-tri-tried, tried, tried
We tri-tri-tried
We tri-tri-tried, tried, tried
We tri-tri-tried
We tri-tri-tried, tried, tried, tried, tried, tried
Tri-tri-tried
We dont connect anymore, far, far, far gone
We dont connect anymore, far, far, far gone
We dont connect anymore, far, far, far gone
We spent last summer, we spent last summer so differently
Tell me youre ready, tell me youre ready to walk away
Were goin down, were goin downhill
Oh, were goin downhill
Were goin down, were goin downhill
Oh, were goin downhill
Were goin down, were goin downhill
Oh, were goin downhill
Were goin down, were goin downhill

I dont think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last four shows
I do one song and use four flows
She used to be a Christian before
Now, all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like, Baby, those are cute, I adore those
Me and the salesman build a rapport so
He understand the fact that Im spending offshore dough
Cash-only transactions, homie
And please, no receipts—the feds like to explore those
They cant audit if they dont know I bought it
Been doing it for years, homie; thoroughly, I thought it...
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track
Admitting most of my currency’s imported
But too late now, its too legitimate to hit em with...
A lawsuit, even if those are acts that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker playing in the whip
As they pull me over, my sweet surrender
I got a Jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A Menschkeit, as they say; he’s a legal bender
And ATF is present, every regal member
The coalition is so efficient
You have to be invited, or theres no admission
We know tradition, we spend money
So dont try to compete if you in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is just solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Used to record in the basement that Renny grew his piff in
When Pops turned over keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess Im cool with Pippen
Til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team-playing, no screen-setting
Because I wanna win games, Coach, Im through assisting
The takeover, the breaks over, nigga
And Ima keep killing em until the day that Drakes over
The waits over, the tapes coming
They bullshitting, but I am equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality, so eager to hate something
And try to play it off like it aint jumping
And its the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased sound vacant
Cause I have just been sittin in this cell
Thinking what I couldve done to make my first video groundbreaking
And whenever Im flowing on the mic
Aside from talking bout the D Im throwing in your wife
I treat this one session as if it were my last

Work, work, work, work, work, work
She said me haffi work, work, work, work, work, work
She see me do mi dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt

I believed all of your dreams, admiration
You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took the heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken the love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that youve never seen
Something that youve never been
Mmmmm-mmm-mmm
Better wake up and act like nothings wrong

I will not talk to no woman, nor will attempt to
And I hope that it gets to you
I hope that you see this true
I hope that you see this through
What can I say?

Long distance, I need you
When I see potential, I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I dont wanna rush into it if its too soon
But you need to get done, done, done, done
At work, come over
Sorry if Im way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin
How many more shots until youre rollin?
More blue dot, more champagne 
More good love to heal our pain 
Things havent been the same
You need to forward and give me all the work
Work, work, work, work, work, work
She said me haffi work, work, work, work, work, work
She see me do mi dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
So me put in work, work, work, work, work, work

Young Frank

And mental pictures were taken, I never forget they faces
Theyre lucky I cant draw, but still Im artistic
Money on the way Its got both of my palms itching
You boys in the wrong business, for real
You boys in the wrong business
All this sitting back and watching will make you a strong witness
Testify on how Im living, make sure its non-fiction
Don’t leave out anybody that put me in this position
We couldn’t have done it better
We changed this city forever
Puffin shisha, lay back fucking with FIFA
What I get for the feature I wouldnt fuck with me either for real
Now Im in it for the hoes and the checks
Care less about respect from niggas I never met
Champagne
I know my city going crazy right about now
Broke nigga, so Im greedy
Break a nigga down if they dont feed me
Yo girl break her neck the same second that she see me
And I bet my last nickel that she eff with Sweet Petey
Bradley Cooper, a future is limitless
Im infinite, take a photo of the synthesis
Grandmama got Alzheimers but shell remember this
Aint no way that she wont remember
I wake up every mornin shower, gather my belongings
But I just quit my job, but got some pussy cause Im balling
From AM to PM, beefing with the BM
Beefing with the boss, got fired by the GM
Fuck, I lost my nigga to a goddamn murder
In his own kitchen, with his own goddamn burner
You aint no goddamn boss
You a goddamn worker
Fuck beef when niggas dying for a goddamn burger
My nigga, all we know is this pain
Chain smoking in the city where they smoke you for chains
Jamaica house to croaker spot, riding round smokin pot
On Broad Street we all drink -- PBR and Rolling Rock
Do this to get money, that aint enough
Do this for my city, that aint enough
Im like Andre 3k, 16 aint enough
I get down like Curtis Snow
Dare you to call my bluff
Bet you it wont pick up
We ride box Chevys but we built Ford tough
And I bet you that we wont give up
The pigs try to lock us down

I dont even need a note pad for this one right here man
Shut the lights off
Let the mind work ya know
Id like to ummm
Id like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
Guess Ill call her my most recent addition to my collection to female disappointments
Deceiving you are the reason that
I dont believe in finding the love that I need and
Im Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes you Aunt Viv
Until you take from me till the point that you cant give
And when I see you out I pass by its offensive
But what you expect though
Kinda direct yo
Cause all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasnt satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasnt tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldnt utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I aint ya understudy thats tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you
Cause now we sit around the studio and clown you
Oops did I let that slip
Oh my bad did I let that slip
I cant forget that quick
Deceiving 
Deceiving 
Deceiving you are the reason that
When it gets cold in November seems like its freezing
And I fit every stereotype that yall believe in
Cause when I say Im serious you claim youre only teasin
I planned a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when Im speakin you only in topic when Im pissed
And in a couple years I guarantee youll be thirsty
And by then Ill be lookin like Tropicana twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me Im just here workin waitin patient
For her to be ready for to love and leave her drama
Cause I dont really wanna fight no more
And I dont wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I dont wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now Im losing a feeling
You losing appealing
You need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I cant forget that quick
Deceiving 
Deceiving 
My first reaction was damn girl
How did I swing you?
I wanted you forever now Im something you cling to
But you was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin ya thing too
Sayin to my self you deceiving
You are the reason that I dont believe in finding the love that I need
In fact I know you always be lyin when u be leavin
Goin to visit family promise me you aint cheatin
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that you a soft nigga
How you think cuddling with is cute
They laugh at how you think you last when you really dont
And make u think u get the ass when you really wont
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin it
So sign your name on a prenupt and then initial
She only messin with a rapper if its beneficial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I cant forget that quick
Deceiving 
Deceiving 
Feel like uh
I feel like we back man 
Its like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs
We makin beyond and above songs you know what Im sayin
We sayin real stuff we not bitter its life you know
If yall females would pull it together

Hands are tied
Someones in my ear from the other side
Tellin me that I should pay you no mind
Wanted you to not be with me all night
Wanted you to not stay with me all night
I know, you know, who that person is to me
Doesnt really change things

Call me when you feel inspired, never when youre bored
And have a real conversation with your fuckin boy
With the fuckin man, Mr. Lover-Lover-Man
How come everything is always on the other hand?
How come you aint never busy when Im busy
But the moment that Im free
You always end up with some other plans?
How you make a good dude wait so long?
I dont understand why, thats some girl shit
And what you doin in the bedroom with your clothes on?
I want you wearin what you came into the world with
This is your chance to prove that you got the skill
Dont let me fool yah
Boy, you dont know me
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
You said you could give me the chills
Come here and let me school yah
This is how its done
Well its all up to you
Boy you gotta push my buttons
But you dont know what to do
The ones that turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Hey, woo!
Girl this very, very moment, yeah

I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I said I do I do I do I do I do
I said I do I do I do I do I do
I said now what it is, what it do, homegirl aint got a clue
If I get you open all the things that I would do to you
Smack it up, flip it down, weigh it up, break it down
Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya who’s ya daddy now
Aint even gotta open your eyes, know what your looking at
And I aint even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact
Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact
Now shes my ride or die, it’s us against the world
You know we both hustlin’ so hustlin’ is our world
Said I mustve had too much to drink I’m in my G-Mode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause it’s the G-Code
Promise if I get locked, you’ll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me, you’ll ring the alarm
And everytime you give it to me it’s gon be the bomb
And in these unlucky streets you’re gon’ be my lucky charm
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I said I do I do I do I do I do
I said I do I do I do I do I do
Man, that boy so cold, give him a blanket in here
I d-o, I d-o, I d-o, oh, oh
I, Vito, promise to treat this game, i-de-al
Honor the code, not bring drama to mama’s peephole
Life’s a bitch but shes the only love that I know -ow -ow
So la-a-dee, after the “I Do’s” lets do Mercedes
Lets tie the knot, lets grab us a pot, lets make a baby
Looking back, I don’t know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me
I, Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And til the task force roll
To hug her every corner til I get ash from the cold
Or until I’ve amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold
Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever, ever
Your secret’s I treasure, for better or worse
You’ll always be my first love til death do us part
Pull a hearse up, my verse up
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I said I do I do I do I do I do
I said I do I do I do I do I do
I do, I do, I do, I do
Unh, Please put away the cameras
Cause we just in the club getting MC Hammered
And God forbid we ever trade our wisdom for the glamor
And I know Im just a boy that a woman could make a man of
So make me one, I know that you can make me one
I just want a woman that looks 30 when shes 81
Please dont give it all away, I hope that you can save me some
The more they pass they heart around, there more jaded that they become
But this one special, so I make sure my suit will fit
The one my daddy wore in June of 85, Im too legit
Im just tryna get her in the mood
And having her doing all the things shed only do when she get married
So lets do this shit
Tell the reverend, all we missing is his blessing
Because before she popped the pussy, she need me to pop the question
So we exchanged vows, they clapped, we take a bow
And shell be doing tricks for daddy, when we take it to the house...
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I said I do I do I do I do I do
I said I do I do I do I do I do
Nothings more attractive than a heavy praying woman
To a him when those and them been defecating on me 
Her would sense the heaven, and him when Andre omen
Baby I’m hell, save me, don’t bail
Crazy I tell you all of this in the middle of a club
Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like like like love
Friend, rock star and So and so’s a genius
So him vow to never utter him do unless him mean it
Her proud like her mother and ooohh momma’s sweet
So you just know that Juicy fruit aint gon’ fall too far from tree
So if we ever woop the woop
I want all that bleepty bleep
On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee
Say I do I do I do I do I do
So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
Lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil’ cocoon
And maybe 2030 our baby, she’ll be nerdy make the whole club swoon
Shell love books and cook and look just like you
And when shes done being young, shell dress like you
Well call her Love 22, shell tote a 22, the laser version
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I said I do I do I do I do I do

Youve been home for three whole days

Late night when you need my love

That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin with some girls Ive never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just dont get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you dont belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls Ive never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling

Diamonds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished
No love for these bitches I said this year it’s all business
It is a shame that a couple of ‘em are off limits
No offence to my nigga, it’s just the industry is small
We all lust for the same women
You know the ones we saw before we came in it
I know he aint trippin’
I know I got a couple things that Lil’ Wayne dipped in
Aint ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it
This shit is all about hits and misses
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up
Don’t let them fuck your life up
Half a mill to perform, I can’t let them fuck that shit up
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it’s lit up
Jim Moore got me dressing like a leading man
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand
Young Frank, suits cut right always
Just got a couple Warhol’s for my hallways
New verses crush the hood like I’m driving into something
Bitches on the kid like I’m Iverson of something
Like a Sixer, since I sold 680 in my first
Drizzy Drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse

Niggas in the city hating me man they tripping
When Im the only one thats really spitting
My nigga Lil Lee the only one thats really gripping
Why you dap me up acting like like we cool if you dont feel him nigga?
Uh, Im bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop
Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the Timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time Im blabbing on
These rappers that feel a certain way but they give me dap and all
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
Im at the do like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they nigga
Wouldnt even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that yall niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpios Mind has many dimensions
Ill say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin
That its crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin
Nickelus F from Richmond, VA
The Scorpios Mind is not a game to play wit all day
Ive been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they dont show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If thats not how it is its how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause Im harnessing a weapon, wont you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around, to perfection Im the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you Im spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, look the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
Its not a problem wit X, I guess Im a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, I expected this
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The citys mine like Oklahomas a Sooner state
And were gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why dont you walk up in the spot using less strut
You aint Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protege, thats the reason I dont holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors

Well, alright, here I go
Im a rapper-turned-singer, and you can tell that he smoke
But I dont need my vocal cords, all I hit is C-notes
N.E.R.D. flow, I spaz if Im pre-voked
Im about to change the fucking game, pass the remote
Money is everything, and its every other thing
Im part of the choir, thats the motto that my brother sing
Cash is the right now, women are postgame
MoneyOverBitches dot com, check the domain
Its coming too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say, Yeah, once in a blue moon
Oops, I mean a red moon, I did it again, Tune
Let me leave a space in for your Blood affiliation, I state
Heavy metaphors, flow so overweight

Young Angel, Young Lion, Im done tryin

And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listened back and now Im sounding like a trumpet
This for all the strippers cause I know that they gone bump it
Tell em, Back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it
Aint no pistols here, your money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back-and-forth faxes
My money coming full circle, get up on my axis
Nebby, Ima kill em, only cause I promised
They think Im bein cocky, but Im only bein honest
Im swallowin the Goose, got a model gettin loose
And I never party less I got some bottles in the booth
I just walk up on the scene, Im about to take this
Im just havin patience, cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee State shit
Drop a four in it and appreciate the greatness, Drizzy
 I just want yall to remember

And yes, Im fallin, but up, I fall
And if your bitch in heat, she could fuck my dog
I went from penny pinchin to private planes
Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter, Carter, ball harder
Ten girls, penthouse suite, yall order
Whatever yall please: wine, crackers, and cheese
They take off their clothes and put on my tees
The supplement Ive taken got me feelin mighty
My gun and money dont split, call that shit Siamese
Yes, my watch make the frickin time freeze
Your girl bless me, she suck my dick and I sneeze
Cheap-ass apartment, just the kitchen I need
And 18 Gs is why the chicken crossed the street
Whatcha know bout it? My niggas so about it
If you kill everybody, they cant go to court about it
Weezy, I ignore the liars, baby, I ignite the fire

Got the shotty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
Im a bad boy, obviously, pop one at your Ivy League
I dont have a rivalry, if so, youll have a cah-sualty
Oops, I meant a casualty, oops, I meant catastrophe
Oops, I meant, actually, you niggas is just ass to me

So much that come with being famous, it can drive ya crazy 
Go check the drugs my brother takin, hes hallucinatin 
How the hell you go and tell Nana I sold my soul to Satan?

Somebody grab him and pinch him, please, this aint a dream 
Stay off the internet, king, this life aint what it seems 
Fuck all the blogs and the memes out there laughin at me

Some would judge based on what youve been through but
I could never be ashamed of you
I could never
I, I could never 
Youve told me things
Harsh truth to my face
Ive been told to walk away

Things that I would choose to do with you if I had time though
Thousand times I fucked you in my mind, trust me I know
Everybody said that I let you down
And let the truth but I can still be found, yeah
Lost my way and only you were there
Could you ever be ashamed of me?

Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscato
For the girl whos a student and her friend whos a model
Finished the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He aint in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl ya on fire can I be the one you match with
I give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where ya tats is
Show me where ya hands at, maybe I can grasp it
They say if ya get her you can understand her better
And she known to be a cheater but thats only if you let her
Yeah, and I got it together
So when they talk they try deter me its like whatever
Tell em I appreciate the help but I just gotta know for myself
This lifestyle is foul this shitll damage ya
Especially when you think noone is understanding ya
These girl groups with they overprotective managers
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space
You remind me of Tonys sister in scarface
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate
Goodness gracious on top is such a hard place
Yea... but if you never even been there
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures in ya swimwear
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air
I know that shit is exhausting girl
And your mistakes are costing girl

Can I, can I save you from you
Cause you know theres something missing
And that champagne you been sipping
Not suppose to make you different all the time
Its starting to feel like the wrong thing to do 
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things Imma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, well be fine
Trying to convince myself I found one
Making a mistake I never learned from
I swear I always fall for your type 
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type 
For your type
I just cant explain this shit at all 
I believe in people like you
Cause who am I to judge you on the past girl
I bet theres a reason for it all
You say that youre nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you dont let me down right now
But its too late, cause Im already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts wont break
And end up like before
Uh look, dress hanging off your shoulder barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and startin over
Girl quit playing you just drunk you just sayin shit
And you dance, dance all high, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait, no I get it
Girl I’m wit it
I’ve been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn
I wonder why I never learn my lesson
Its feeling like a second chance and it’s the first impression
And I heard there’s nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cause man it’s been a while and I swear that this ones different
That’s why Ima take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again
About how reckless I have been
And I’m slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes
And I’m just trying to correct it, and I fall

Yeah
9th Wonder
Dont judge me, man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, Te and El bout to prove em wrong, though
Ugh, we know what youre thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you dont really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you dont really know me like you think you know me
They dont be saying how Im humble, Im hella nice
Or that Ive been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
They just tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
Thats why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they aint thinking Drake get smart, girl
Nah, they probably think Ill break your heart, girl
Haha, I cant lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, Ill probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I dont know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I couldve been a local emcee
And you probably wouldve been worse off
So Ima take this hat off, and Ima hit it till Im back soft
And then I backs off
Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason Im thinking Im getting sick of rapping
Ugh, we know what youre thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you dont really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you dont really know me like you think you know me
You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think youve been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I aint a tip-drill, dont care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, Id gladly oblige
First name Phonte, Id be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But Im from the South where if you aint snapping
Or rapping bout trapping yous a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit youve been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me youll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, cause I aint dumb, shit, Im well-read like sunburn
And after me, youll never leave no stone unturned
Ugh, we know what youre thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you dont really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you dont really know me like you think you know me
Yeah, they say you never judge a book by its cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take em in
And I dont see what you saying, so they coming off paper-thin
Thats when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down
To see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle
To get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasnt on the same page
I wouldve gave you strong play
But your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now, Im closing the case
You only out for the paperback, thats written all over your face
No, El will never judge a book by its cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under
Ugh, we know what youre thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you dont really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love

Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
Think I had the motherfucking plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I’m the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we don’t need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
That’s why I’m ready man
I’d never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I’m going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn’t see ya’ll
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig
I said I know you see me chilling super low key
If I’m with the right niggas, you can scoop an O.Z
All the hustlers and the bouncers and the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades in a coupe with no keys
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cutting, we can cut some more
Then after you get high
Make em, get em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got a lota dough plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain’t heard? I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They ain’t really got a choice, it’s an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it’s a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I live at, fifty thousands going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin’ on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I ain’t acting like I’m rude
I’m just acting like I’m rich, rich
Riding with Weezy fucking Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fucking, baby?
Cause I don’t waste time, can’t you see a nigga lazy
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezy’s fucking crazy
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig
Y-M, bitch, everyday
Two times on Sunday

Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year

My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me

 
More time with family and friends. More Life.
 
Ive still got vibrations to send. More Life.
 
They say that we could live forever
 
At night I pray its true
 
Ive done so much in my short time and still theres more to do
 
But if someone should come collecting
Sooner than were all expecting
 
At least the life you lived was one for you

I wanna see whats under therrrrrrrre...baby
Whos that peekin in my window?
Uh, you should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info
Wii can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt + Tab
Switchin in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it aint a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late, and used to blame me
She said Im too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldnt change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie?
We aint even tryna settle, so why try?
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs ?light up? when theyre in them shoes, ohhh
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
 
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
 girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, GIRL, girl
My homies never see you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I type you a message full of Xs and Os
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though I hate this distance, it keeps me persistent
One day Ill have your ass up in this kitchen
 
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl

And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC Serch til I reach 3rd base
And when I get home Ima hit home plate
Wait, could this be considered our first date?

Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad

You know whats a crazy thing?
Some girlsll make you wait longer than A.C. Green
Passion of the Christ, 33-Year Old Virgin

Just wait and see

Before I made it out, I said, Ive got to make it out
And I did, I did, I really did
Switch up the sentiment, rappin on instrumentals
Thats how I paid the rent

Been ten years, niggas hated him, now they cavin in

So hard to breathe this air that we call love 
Aint nothin worse than the hurt we receive from love 
When you get hurt by the one you livin for
Pain can make you wanna love no more
Lovin you no more
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin you no more
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Hurt with the heart thats bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
Im going through hell to convince she love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I’m ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I about to do when her parents do not try
So many tears I cried
But all for nothin I’m afraid to say
Oh
Lovin you no more
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more 
I love you more than I love myself 
Lovin you no more 
I just, I cant, I just can’t be loving you no more 
I love you more than I love myself
I’ve been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is tryin to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life, now its changed
My life, aint the same as you are
Heartbroke to the point sometimes wanna end it
If I can’t have what mean most to me
So many tears I cried 
But all for nothing I’m afraid to say
Oh, oh, oh
Lovin you no more
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more 
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin you no more 
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more 
I love you more than I love myself
Uh, tryin not to over think
Only cause I drove and Ive done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gon do?
Since everything that I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby, then we’d be for sure
So selfishly, you can only show feelings
When you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh, time, oh, time has changed and I’m no longer willing
Cant you see how my heart is bleeding?
I guess I…
Lovin you no more
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more 
I love you more than I love myself 
Lovin you no more 
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more 
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin you no more 
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin you no more
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more

Im fed up Im fed up Im fed up
Im so sick and tired of being sick and tired
I am absolutely, positively on my grizzy
Even though Im sick and Im tired, I gets busy

And me, I like to stand at the stove until Im dizzy
Ball so hard its like I brought the game with me
Left my glove so white you thought I brought Jermaine with me

Uhh, me and Wayne was gettin high on em
He leaned over and told me, Just dont retire on em
And when they give ya they shoulders, never cry on em
And when they love you to death, just never die on em
And the question still remains
Have I counted all the money that Ive managed to obtain?
Niggas dedicatin overtime to damagin my name
And somehow Im still the hottest motherfucker in the game
 I’m tired of these haters
That’s why I go hard like A.C. Slater
Weezy Baby here, y’all pre-natal
I just get the beat and murk it out like Fredo
Uhh, I’m sick of bein criticized

Yeah, hop out, I been in this, been breakin records since 94
So I aint gotta brag about records that I’ve broke
Records that I hold and records that I’ve sold
And I’m fed up with these niggas relieving my lingo 
Don’t bite the hand of your provider
You sayin I ain’t influenced you, you a liar
I’m on fire, you just a biter
You need to wake up and realize
Yeah, yeah
It was all a dream, yeah homie I am on my job
And you cant take that away from me
Yeah I got my team, and I got all of my niggas behind me
And they give me the love I need 
I got my foot in the door, still hustling for more
Check in the game now Im back in the light, yeah
Im fed up Im fed up Im fed up

Im sitting outside man Im right in the truck
Bags packed, pack of black and milds lighting them up
Im looking down on these niggas while inviting them up
Id like to know the reasoning behind subliminals
Like who told them to mention me?
I am elevated homie, you are elementary
Telling them you selling dope and never sold a Century Sam
Saying you get denied off your entry exam
You get flow and you done fo, converse in one verse
About you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
And ask Juicy if I Stay Fly
On the cellphone, and got a ten on the other end like an eight bi
Six two and they tell me you ye high
They cant but they try, still get offended if I dont say hi
To me its kinda gay if Im saying hi to like eight guys
So I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and pen these raps
Bust them shots, pretend you trap, do whatever man
Long as you never find your way home Im cool with it
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it
I never bust a gun, Im Mister C-T-V
At least, Im not Mister Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, Im cuttin records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you flowin Jeezy
Slow your roll this aint a diss song
This song, will let you know Im not the one to pick on
White with the yellow, the over easy Im a swiss on
Only got a couple girls that Im willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on
If they wanna smoke they get they purple goodie twist on
But I cant call it, maybe you mad cause you fellas looking celibate
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh
And Im official, whats officially true
Is callin names would only be beneficial to you
I just tiring you niggas, yall the michelin crew
I know a response is something that you itching to do
And YOU? youre smaller to me then a thumb tack
Music enjoy it, well Im just tryna bring the fun back
But you making out all these dumb tracks, ya LL sixteens
Cause I listen to them and I dont call it come BACK
Its more like a shame or disgrace
Considering Im the one that you aim to displace
But you the one I blame in this case
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your awkward ass singles, the lamest mixtapes
And this is whats making you say you came to get Drake
And Im thinking the hoods right for you
The sun shines on my career its goodnight for you, uh
Im thinking the hoods right for you

Its what you all been waiting for, aint it?
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat and go head, claim it
Im about to paint a picture, you niggas go head, frame it
Since we getting Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards, I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So its obvious yall gon steady be rolling with some jokers
And me, Im rolling with some brokers
Like, damn, could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, dont even approach her
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume
I am making stocks work while you working stock rooms
Ugh, and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Petes sakes
You fake gangsta rappers are cliche
And if you aint talking dough when you meet Drake
Ill be all in your face, like, No speak-a la ingles
Soon as you hear it, you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me, Im aware, and my cars right there
Is this interior enough for yall ulterior motives?
Cause if you like it, yall should stick with me
My money good, I aint never had to flip a ki
A lot of ice, a lot of cream like Dickie Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Michie Mee
But Ima try and have you on the trip with me
Sliding through Henri Bendel like its slippery
And your ex-man is a hater, officially
Probably cause he know Im exactly what you wish he be
Yeah, thats the reason why he looking hard
Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad cause his girls at the house
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he couldve been Gotti in the flicks
But at this point, Im just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays, rapping is a childrens hobby
And girls keep telling me Im still this snobby
I tell them myself is who I am feeling, probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It aint a song that your ass finna skip
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she dont really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just lets me know that we aint on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
Im outta here, baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldnt take it back, nah, not if they paid me
Mr. Bet You Thats Expensive cause its not a fugazi
Spitting a Crock Pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasting?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macys

Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well, Im thinking I should leave out on this note

Pots on the stove, but I dont do bakin
Famous Crip, plus I got blue faces
He catchin bodies, he aint catchin cases
Dont shoot the whole clip, my nigga, dont waste it
Goods in the mansion, my nigga, dont take it

How you workin hard and its just a day shift? 
Im in the Wraith, it feel like a spaceship
Uh

But she wanna call it baecation
I wanna know where the hate is
I do not know who the fake is
Niggas aint get you no statements

How you broke? I make money off Caitlyn
I was broke, no one believed in me
I became what she aint see in me
Now you see how she treatin me
Now she sees the G in me, she aint leavin me
Now her and her friends, they believe in me
Even the opps still believe me, whole gang, they believe me
I dont know what to do with me
Im bigger than what they see in me

Hmm-mm-mm-mm

How you workin hard and its just a day shift?
Im in the Wraith, it feel like a spaceship
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Used to have bashments down in the basement
Look in the ceiling, pink foam insulation
Now we just link up for corporate occasions
Say she been fuckin with me since the Hazelton
If I dont like how hes movin, Im pagin him
Hear that they dissin, back then, I was raisin em
Niggas is in for the rudest awakenin
Walls are so tall, I don’t know who my neighbor is
Baka, my crodie, his songs are amazing
But I knew that nigga when he wasnt makin em
Yeah
Turned this to a organization
Rap-A-Lot Mob, we tied up like laces
Bank in Bahamas, you know Im evasive

If its a problem, Im droppin location
Or I send Kayla, shes very persuasive
Yeah, huh
Turned this to an organization
I fuck the bitch, I leave her waitin
This car a demon, you know that Im Satan
Ear cost a mill, me and Buck was at Nathan

I see the mills, man, I could taste it
How you workin hard and its just a day shift?

The clock that youve been watching has been stoppin
He makes you wait, what kind of man does that to a girl he wants
If you just give tonight to me I promise my hands will say
Theyll say
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarms
Even though the traffic downtown dont show no mercy
Think about the last time I came through
I had something more than a gift for you
And I dont only fuck you like that on your birthday
Baby I just landed
Bout to get my bags and all I needs an address
And Im on my way
Dont fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise its worth waiting for

I can see it in your eyes, youre angry
Regret got shit on what youre feeling now
Mad cause she aint like me
Oh youre mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now youre tryna find somebody
To replace what I gave to ya
Its a shame you didnt keep it
Dont need ya, could care less
I know that you gon hear this
Im the best, yeah I said
Boy, Im the best, dont you forget it
The way you walk, thats me
The way you talk, thats me
The way you got your hair cut
Did you forget thats me?
The voice in your speaker right now
Thats me, thats me
And that voice in your ear, thats me
Cant you see, that I made it, yeah I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And youre wasted with your ladies
Yeah Im the reason why you always getting faded
Take a shot for me, oh, oh, woah
Take a shot for me, oh, oh, woah
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me
Okay look, Im honest, boy I cant lie I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated for the record back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me, boy I dont get you
He says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause youre always busy doing things
I really wish he had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that were from just kinda ruined things
I can tell that youve been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin for your happiness, hope that you recover
Cause baby Im the best
Im the, Im the best
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Take a shot for me, oh, oh, woah
Take a shot for me, oh, oh, woah
Take a shot for me

When love was found
I kept my hope just like Id hoped to
Then sang to the sea for feelings deep blue
Comin down
And weve had problems that weve grown through
But I bet you dream of what you could do
At seventeen I was alright
Was like nothin I could feel inside
And wishing you were here tonight is like holdin on
But I still get to see your face, right?
And thats like nothin they can take, right?
So there wont be no feelin in the firelight
Hopin this will be right
Time to show your worth, child
I remember when her heart broke over stubborn shit
Thats no way to be livin, kid
The angel of death is ruthless
And Im always thinkin summertime with the bikes out
Pushing our luck getting wiped out
Days with nothin but laughin loud
Underneath my coat, wont you tap my shoulder, hold my hand?
Nights with nothin but dark in there
You can be my armor then
Island smiles and cardigans
The nights that weve been drinkin
And were here to help you kill all of this hurt that youve been harborin
Confessions should be better planned
Alone, that night, Im surely damned
Run away and Ill understand it
Whats important is this evenin I will not forget
Purple, blue, orange, red
These colors of feelin
Give me love, Ill put my heart in it
And I think about it all the time
The lights went out, you were fine
You kinda struggle not to shine
I still love you, though
I still love you, though
I still love you always
So hold me when Im home, keep the evenings long
Crack and break and part ways
I still love you, though
I still love you, though
I still love you always
So hold me when Im home, keep the evenings long
Lets not crack and break and part ways
And I wonder if I could let her down
Furthest Thing
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between Im sober and Im lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in, they dont even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin they can say now
Nothin really changed, but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin was the same
And Ive still been drinkin on the low, mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low, smokin on the low
Ive still been plottin on the low, schemin on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know, yeah
And I hate that you dont think I belong to you
Just too busy runnin this to run home to you
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I cant change what happened
I cant help it, I cant help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she were mine and no one elses
Now you hate me, stop pretendin, stop frontin, I cant take it
Girl, dont treat me like a stranger, girl, you know Ive seen you naked
Girl, you know that I remember, dont be a pretender
Gettin high at the condo, thats when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscin and make-up sex is tradition
But youve been missin, girl
And you might feel like nothin was the same
And Ive still been drinkin on the low, mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low, smokin on the low
Ive still been plottin on the low, schemin on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
And I wonder if I could let her down
Its for real, its for real

I cant stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I cant stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I cant stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I cant stop missing you
No, no, no, no
Nah
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars, I got a nice house
But now Im steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I wouldve cared more
Thats my only feeling inside whenever I get a song done
Im scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now its like a shock to my pride
I dont care if she know
Cause thats basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies
More records, more sex, more babies
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you, Im tryna make you a missus
I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way you wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here till the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
Its everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out? Do you still live at your old house?
Do you got somebody new in your life?
Cause I cant get you outta my mind
And I wanna erase but I cant stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why cant I get over it?
Simply cause I cant
I cant stop missing you 
Wish I was still with you 
I cant stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I cant stop missing you 
Wish I was still with you 
I cant stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I cant stop
Missin everything you say
Missin all the crazy love we made
Whyd you throw it all away?
I want you to know its been hell tryna do this without you here
Baby 07 supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was going out
Cause I knew you were tellin me lies
And I cant get that outta my mind
And I wanna erase but I cant stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why cant I get over it?
Simply cause I cant
I cant stop missing you 
Wish I was still with you 
I cant stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I cant stop missing you 
Wish I was still with you 
I cant stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I cant stop
I cant stop missing you 
Wish I was still with you 
I cant stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I cant stop missing you 
Wish I was still with you 
I cant stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I cant stop
I cant stop, missing you
I cant stop, missing you
 I cant stop missing you
 I cant stop missing you
No, no, no, no

Its fuckin losers like you that make me do what I do
Make me hate where Im from, you as fake as they come
Everybody got guns, who the fuck gonna squeeze
Everybody got songs, but you aint fucking with these
Why you wish to be ghetto, tell me whats it about
While youre tryna get in were all tryna get out
Why dont you just be yourself, why dont you tell us the truth
Like how you only load guns when you up in the booth
You aint nothin to shoot, you dont even exist
Youre just a fantasy family as weak as it gets
And you aint speakin to Bish, cause I dont listen to chicks
I dont argue with broads, cause Im really a pimp
But I will tell you this, as far as yall are concerned
Pull out my Santa Claus, and make the holidays burn
You can call me the Grinch, cause yall are nothing but Whos
Just another bunch of low lifes with nothing to do
Now let the kids play like the riders ride
We spendin all day, these niggas idolize
They claim they want fame nigga so we decided
That we gon make em some stars until the drama dies
But they can go back to they holes where they mama lies
Or write more lies about they drugs, guns or homicide
Funny, claim the thug life that they abidin by
But run up on em, then they turn into the silent type, they wanna compromise
My niggas, we ride or die
And roll with them bitches that got they body right
These niggas aint built, aint got the body type
Time to break a niggas spirit like the Amistad, tryna fool the audience
Feel the ambience
Stars in your presence, kings of the city are appalled by the peasants
Aint gotta say names, we can all get a reference
Brains and the info from your broads in the west end
Masters, flowing staggers on bars
Nigga stay mad cause his swaggers on Mars
Yall niggas aint thinking we calling yall tards
Claim you want war, okay, on guard
Ayo, hey you Mr. Rapper Guy
When you in the booth, tell me why you have to lie
Come on, spit the truth, all I hear is bang bang, hustle this, hustle that
But if you hustle crack, then where the money at?
No proof, Dr. Seuss, story tellin when he rhyme, like
Once upon a time I was really on the grind
Theres another lie, couldnt out-hustle me
Hatin when it come to D, I can take youre starting 5
Im only goin at generic rap niggas that
Rap about kis but couldnt show me 10 Gs
And these nigga dry snitching on they tees
Standing out, like a sore thumb to the Ds
My nigga please, if you really had work
You would do what you do and wouldnt put it on your shirt
It makes my heart hurt when dumb niggas act hood
You aint no hustla, just a nigga that can rap good
See theres a height requirement, nigga to mention my name 
How the fuck you little niggas didnt stay in your lane
Man you offered me a truce and I took it
Now I hear this bullshit so how the fuck am I to overlook it?
If this little nigga survive then it gotta be God
How the fuck are you a hustla with your factory job ?
And I dont get it, nigga Im a fucking diabetic
And I dont usually eat yall sweet niggas
Every time I see yall retard niggas yall bitch out
Waddup Roxx? now we cool? then you dip out
Talkin all that bang bang shit, pull a clip out
Sayin you a blood, next week you prolly crip out
Im saying, we dont believe yall niggas 
G-35, x5 nah niggas 
This here is a public announcement for my niggas 
No more goodnight, good mornin, goodbye niggas
I dont appreciate niggas sayin my name in they bullshit
Its like putting a knife against the lyrical full-clip
Do shit on my own, I never asked for help
If I was rapping like yall I woulda killed myself
And nah, this aint beef, its missing a few ingredients
Dog you aint a general, stick to being obedient
Piggy back, that aint something I had to do
Laughing at Drake? you shoulda seen how I was laughing at you
I dont beef over little shit, angry? A little bit
Little niggas get little recognition you little bitch
I dont do the little subliminals, Im addressin it
And if Littles wanna get in the middle then Im suggesting it
They called you a bitch, were tryna act out
They challenge em to a fight and then they back out
So tell me how the fuck I can respect you cats
If you a gangsta, then what part of the game is that?
Hey yo Aristo, Im lost, can you tell me whats goin on in the streets?
How it feel to count dough while you palmin the heat?
And yes I asked for a 16, you did your 16
I heard that weak shit and only wanted the beat 
But fuck the money and the cars that I drive to set
And fuck the women thats lying to all the guys they met
And fuck the features on my songs and the deals on the table
Or basically its fuck everything that you strive to get
And its the room of resolution, Im finishing it in here
If I copy Buddens flow, you mimickin his career
And the same money we hearin you giving to charity
You need to be giving to Littles to give him some clarity 
Cause thats your homeboy I think hes owed that much
Tell him pressing 25 dont mean you sold that much
And Breana, I dont mean to alarm ya
But you need to get outside the car to shoot this video in Parma 
You act like you hood and hood niggasll harm ya
And this is not hatin my nigga we call it karma
But yo Thug Life, show me where the hammer be
Yes I took an L on my own and they didnt damage me
You try to cover up your lies like a canopy
And tryna pull 17 year olds down in Bramalea 
And we dont got it out for you
We just saying that dont nobody vouch for you
Nope, nobody thorough is willing to give a cosign 
And you dont even sell blow, you just blow time
You cant even get a factor grant
So stop rapping, go fix parts at a tractor plant 
And listen here, Tetley Tea
You one of the seven dwarfs standing next to me
You probably snitchin in court, then accept the plea
And I hear you paying these women and I sex for free 
But dog, how did this start, how we get to this part?
We all got niggas doing bids Mr. Wishheart 
Its not cool to use another niggas as a threat tho
I said you a bitch, I heard a seven man echo
You saying I hustle, my source for currency coke
They saying you never moving it and currently broke
And you risk doing crack time and hang around black crime
Just so you can have something to say in you rap lines
They say Drake killed it like young girls at a private school 
Dog if I were you, I tell you what I would do
I would cut ties with the cops and just make them fire you
Lose the body pack and the velcro you feed the wire through
Tell them not to call and thats even if they require you
Cause they the only people recording that wanna hire you 
With what I spend in a weekend I could acquire you
Some of them believe you got money you little liar you
But, I dont admire you, short niggas tell tall tales

Uh yeah man, VO
Back again like we never left huh
Im sending this out to any of my girls thats different man
Anybody thats special
You know I wanna be honest with you women so Imma start off like this
Uh look, Im bold from the get go, go by the title of Drake
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
Im hopin that aint nobody else as special as you
When I say Ive been disappointed Im addressing a few
I finesse then I groove
While most of the 8 to 9s in my past
Now get a rating thats less than a 2
Its true, I been talking to Aleshia, Keisha and Nadia
And Shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of yas
Payback, to the same chicks from way back
Never call, now they wanna be where I stays at
Now they got the new boy, Im trying to move forward
And pass me, classy, something like Drew Lord
A new me, cool, see I never get around
If I dont change now I dont think Ill ever settle down
Even if I gotta travel a bit
Ill go around the world and back
Cause I know that once I have it thats it and uh
You cant just love me like they do
I need someone special in you
I know that out there theres a few
See Ive been searching I dont what to do
Can you help me?
She gotta be special
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
You gotta be special
Cause you never know how people stick around
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name aint change but Im far from the man that I used to be
Since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic
Ever since the demo dog
And groupies are gettin brave
Now they ask me for
Rappers, I write em a verse
And ask me to spit it
But I pay no mind though
Cause they know I know
Hard as these niggas working man
They wont sign so
Drake and VO back
I take it you know that
You take it sitting down
Or you can take it to gold black
And since Drake done took it from curls to waves
Its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
I mean I had my share of women
Now a nigga gettin girls for days
With most of em its seemin like they world is staged
But from Georgia to BK and all around the world
Get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
If youve been hurt and you alone be steady
These the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh
You can just love me like they do
I need someone special in you
I know that out there, theres a few
See Ive been searching, I dont know what to do
Can you help me?
Special
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
Gotta be special
Cause you never know how people stick around
Special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name aint change but Im far from the man that I used to be
Look theres requirements to be an admirer
Still the new version of fresh needa a Nia or Tyra
So we can be Jenny and Swayze
I told you Im careful with my heart girl, many have played me
Or maybe its karma
They say is a charmer
Halfway to a knight so I stay in a armor
Im fire on the move
A tire looking smooth
Im not perfect but I got a desire to improve
Im special
Like kids in a graduating class
Having more trouble than others when adding basic math
Need you to be special like areba to cootmore
Double O, top secret agents with suits on
Something so deep it da drown me
Friends are some cool dudes
I vouch for the people around me
On your end its simple
All you have to do
Is give me no reason for other lovers after you and uh
You cant just love me like they do
I need someone special in you
I know that out there theres a few
See Ive been searching I dont what to do
Can you help me?
Special
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
Special
Cause you never know how people stick around
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yea my name aint change but Im far from the man that I used to be
Vo and D-R
Vo and D-R-A-K-E
We them boys that you came to see 
Yep we take it to the same degree
So let loose since you came with me 
Vo, D-R-A-K-E
We them boys came to see 
Yeah we take it to the same degree
So let loose cause you came -A-K-E
We them boys that you came to see 
Yep we take it to the same degree
So let loose since you came with me 
Vo, D-R-A-K-E
We them boys came to see 
Yeah we take it to the same degree

Who else really try to mess with Hollywood Cole
Treating Birmingham like my Hollywood shows
Im tryin to tell you something that you prolly should know
This that slumdog millionaire Bollywood flow
And ahh, my real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
Thats why I pick and choose
I dont get shit confused
Im not with different crews
We walk the same paths, but got on different shoes
We live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Dont like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
Tell your girl to tell her friend that its time to go
Tell me todays weather
I know they say they good but trust me Im better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
Im cold but still hot you cant decide on a sweater
Really this whatever and I am murdering and this is so amusing
If theres a sight to see I am an illusion
I tell you Im the man baby, what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me someone hit the snooze then
Keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
Im headed for the moon, I aint bout to hit the ceiling
Im about to hit the club, women tell me Im appealing
But fuck what they say, let me tell you how Im feeling
Im drinking, these London street lamps got a real glow
Drizzy playin driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, hes a hater baby he dont know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I aint lyin to the kids, like the dentist aint scary
Im what Lebron was to St. Vincent-St. Marys
But I aint playin high school games
Pulling McClarens through a McDonalds drive through lane
Im too fly, keep it hip-hop like Afu Ra
Girl on that McClaren, you gotta lift the doors

Aww man
Ho! Yes!
Hahaha
Yeah... Can yall hear me out there?
Its a lovely night tonight aint it?
Yeah I know
I know what they thinkin they aint heard the beat they aleady scared
You know how I get down
But look Im just gon keep it real
Id like to know if there is a chemical
Imbalance in your makeup
Yeah
Sometimes I wonder... wonder if you plan
Half of this shit before I wake up
Callin my ex-girl or e-mailin my mama 
Youre the only one
Thats causin me this drama
And then expect favors 
When you come in town
And I know if I see you guaranteed its goin down
Cause
Too stay with this girl 
You couldnt pay me!
I respect a woman
But this bitch is crazy 
This bitch is crazy 
This bitch is crazy
I respect a woman 
But this bitch is crazy
She dont even know
Thats the craziest part right?
She just oblivious to the whole shit like
And you know like I was sayin sometimes
I gotta get my R&B on you know
I wanna wear the wife beaters
With the slit at the top so
I can tear it easy and all that
I wanna sing in the rain girl
You know what Im talkin bout
Yea
I need a R&B name too like uh... like uh... like
I dont know Ill think of it
Hey!
Hahaha
You crazy man for real
Ho!
Oh well nigga fall back ho!
Goddamn

Yes
Im on that old, switch lanes shit, Jay, Big, Dames shit
Talking bout them niggas that my daddy pitch cane wit
Because I never learned the biz, I learned the language
Well-spoken, man I shouldve went to Cambridge
And mama would always claim this
I never expected the outcome, but one day I became this
Famous, no longer nameless
More game, but Im the same, I will remain this
Im still focused, I stay grounded
You see I ran with a style when they clowned it
So read 48 Laws if you never read it
Because that is one of the main reasons Im level-headed
Despite the accumulated success
If my attitude ever strayed, I made it regress
I never wanted to win the lottery only because my uncle
Told me He who made it by struggling made it the best
So with that on my chest, Im down on my last 12 gs
Going through the closet thinking I should prolly sell these
Chanel Cs, and LVs, somebody stop before I really start to rebel please
I spend it all, who needs anymore?
Whose satisfied doin good deeds anymore?
Who grieves anymore, who believes anymore?
Who graduated school and still reads anymore?
Not me, that should have my whole race shook
Because we dont read novels but we do FaceBook
The new craze is havin that new age look
If I said I liked it, Id feel like a two-faced crook
Nah, I tell retro kids tie that bandana just a little bit tighter
Til it suffocates you, biter
Cause I dont wear no bright colors or rope chains

Young Money till the young boy dyin out
You hear me cryin out
You see me ridin’ out
And if your man get to stuntin’
We’ll buy em out
Cause we be livin’ what these other rappers lyin bout
Drizzy Drake, what
Funk Flex, uhh
Hot 9-7, I’m so far gone
Feelin good, feelin great, how you though?
Bet you hear my name every single place that you go
Sippin’ on pink shit, but nah it aint Nuvo
Slow the F down fore yo ass is on Pluto
Tell me what it do
I belong to the youngest Grammy nominated crew
My city love me, but I got Toronto haters too
That sit around and talk about
What they’d have done if they was you
But know I ball without a sphere in sight
Club owners give me reasons to appear at night
And just know thatIbe in the mirror like
Are you listenin’? I hope you hearin right
I’m in the Aston doin doughnuts
I will kill the game and never send it my condolence
Taught to never love a chick and only love the moments
New York City, I can tell the people want it
Uhh, what you got for me flex, uh
Vacuum interiors and shined wheels
Whats ya life like? This how mine feels
I like my seat back, I like my wine chill
I look good, smell better, and I rhyme ill
I say I’m at these girls neck and head
You and your girl sleep in separate beds
I killed this, tell Flex its dead
You got birthday cake, mines weddin tall
Yall lemon small, yall never ball

Oh wait, hold up, Young F’n Weezy

Say you want my company
Sometimes I feel so naive
I dont wanna give up on you easy
Things arent easy, I agree
Why you wanna be this cold to me
Why you wanna make me make believe
Things arent what they seem
And it got too deep girl, too deep

People ask what happened, I go silent
I wouldnt even speak on you
But now you wanna mention me
Now you wanna mention me
When you speak on mistakes

Like someone could replace me today
Now you wanna mention me
Some emotional statements were made

Ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh

My yiys too fried 
All these thoughts in my mind
Motives too transparent for me
I know you dont care about me
Dealing with me like some wasteman
You think I live in the palm of your hand
Im too understanding and patient 
Lightning mightve stricken you right where you stand 
And your karma, karmas gonna be a problem
Fell for you straight to the bottom
People ask what happened I go silent
I wouldnt even speak on you
But now you wanna mention me
Now you wanna mention me
When you speak on mistakes
Now you wanna mention me
Like someone could replace me today
Now you wanna mention me
Some emotional statements were made
Now you wanna mention me
Mention me like you’re bored of me
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means more to me
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means more to me
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means
She dey play with my energy, nonstop
You realize that you messing with a gangsta
Oh girl worry bout your karma
Tired everyday a lil drama
If you wanna leave, just leave, no pressure
If you wanna leave, just leave, no pressure
No, no, no pressure

If you wanna leave, just leave, no pressure
No pressure at all

Yeah
Cut it up, gimme a light
Yeah, and by the way, nigga
Its Young Mula
First Lady
Ugh, yo, yo
Let us begin with a bad lil specimen
Balenciagas, only things I be steppin in
Pucci bathing suits, only thing Im dressing in
Cause I get wetter than a navy seal veteran
Got—Got em writin love letters in they jour-n-al
Keep em on they toes like a midget at the urinal
Bad—Bad—Bad-Bad—Bad—Bad as I wanna be
She aint bad, she a sad little wannabe
Yeah. Fuck the bullshit. Its big money popping. Young Mula! Yeah, just like that. What up, young nigga? Lets go. Gudda, brrrat!
Okay, we running this shit, when we walk in the building
Got bitches from wall to wall, hoes hangin from the ceiling
Young Money we bout to kill em, I promise I make a million
And if they didnt have no hands Ill bet them bitches gon feel em
Im talkin money and power; you getting money? I doubt it
Fresher than baby powder, with your bitch in the shower
That pussy, Ima devour; I beat it up til its sour
No need for you to even trip; bitch Ill be done in a hour, lets go
Yeah
Yeah, thats more like it
Junior!
They say the blacker the berry, the redder the cherry
I say the sweeter it is—you dig? Buried
Then the bullshit varies, and it got me wary
But I know two are the same—call it murdered and married 
Hustling is so necessary, with no adversaries
But aint no love, like a calendar with no Februarys
Ima need four secretary, and four Bloody Marys
Ima go eat me some pussy, and choke off the cherry—Im gone
Yeah, fully loaded with it
To the ceiling with it
More money than you ever seen, nigga!
Aight, Drizzy, Drake—
Look, kill the game, no one recovers the murder weapon
Young Angel, if you hate me tell me burn in heaven 
Howd ya sleep on me? The highest earnin freshmen
Like your third infection, I hope you learned your lesson 
Yeah, I spit raw, but I prefer protection
I own a heart and a mind and a shirt she slept in
Bitch, I got the answer, and still aint heard the question
I shut your club down, please reserve my section
Fuck a confrontation, there aint no cake in it
And Im caking, bitch, so tell me why Id take a break from it
The mother of your child always tell you Im her favorite
She call me her baby—not the one she was in labor with
She say, Ooh, you taste good, I say, Ooh, just savor it
She know that she love a nigga, I be on that major shit
Cause I get paid to stand, and I get paid to sit

Boi-1da... Drizzy
Yall dont really like me
I can understand
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket on my pants
Im still fly, you cant float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records, are you saying ghost?
Twenty-thousand for a verse is our routine quote
Im getting rich, uhh, you staying broke
Chillin even if Im in a goose down coat
I cant see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I dont even flinch if you throw me high-fives
They try to measure up, but there is no one my size
Whatever 40s smokin bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement, Im taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
Cause its about to go
I hear my phone ringing when you call
I aint pickin up or entertainin them at all
Got your girl face down, bangin on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang in Lenox Mall
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I cannot relate
Ridin with some tags that I got from out of state
Ridin with a swag that I got from outer space
Just show me whos the hottest, Imma knock him out his place
Call me homicide Drizzy, Im bout to kill your ego
Im about my green, puffin goody like Im Cee-lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And yeah, my G-pass is as valid as can be
Im so fresh, a stylist would agree

Dont you have a man? 
Why are you trying to be my girl? 
I cant believe it 
Dont you have a man? 
Its all right with me, my girl
We can do anything 
Why you over there looking at me
While your man standing right beside you?
The temporary happiness he might provide you
But you know and I know that nobody gon do you like me
Tryna save you like a goalie in line-of-sight
I know that I feel her, but slowly, Im kinda like
I dont really wanna hit this girl
And still, she want this chaps stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, Ima give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under your ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They dont wanna cut it, they want a rapper to cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks Im serious, Im playing around
It gets deeper and colder, the funny thing is
Im writing this in my head as she asleep on my shoulder, like...
Dont you have a man? 
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I cant believe it
Dont you have a man? 
Its all right with me, my girl
We can do anything
Look, we had a lil thing, a wintertime fling
You some getback for your man mistreating
But that was then, you know, some hush-hush
I aint never really see a future in us
Plus, your man still there, lets be fair
Youd do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past some late-nigh- smash
Iont wanna take the place of he
Late nights, 85 South on my way to the crib
And somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about, cause I been the other man
And you not gonna trap me with your silly lil plan
Its my bad, shouldve chose a wo-man
But Im in the mix with this lil girl, playing
Im saying, you need to do what you do
Im not tryna take it any further with you, cmon
Dont you have a man? 
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I cant believe it
Dont you have a man?
Its all right with me, my girl
We can do anything
Ugh, ugh, I met her at the bar, sipping on Patron
And now, its been three years off and on
Cause the same page, we are rarely often on
Cause when Im in, she out, and when she in, Im gone 
We lost contact like Bausch & Lomb
But regained it while she was building a house and home
Wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right
It just proves that she dont know what to do with her life
Cause if so, she wouldnt have to change her strategy
And wouldnt need me to recharge her batteries
One minute, she mad at me; next minute, its all good
And Im in her body like Grays Anatomy
I dont understand why God sent me to you
And I caint try to justify that foul shit we do 
All I know is that each time Im stickin you
I think to myself, Damn, if only her nigga knew, but...
Dont you have a man? 
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I cant believe it
Dont you have a man? 
Its all right with me, my girl
We can do anything
Dont you have a man? 
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I cant believe it
Dont you have a man? 
Its all right with me, my girl

Today the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna.
Captivating from day one, the iconic being that is Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them, thats often the peak, but for her, that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since.
When it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style, she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward.
Whats most impressive isnt the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. Whats most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself.
This woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless its to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasnt changed since day one.

Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club, I was up Im tryna live
Only twenty two, my nig, bout to be twenty three, ya dig?
Time dont wait for none of us thats why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
Im preachin fire, need a choir, bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
We in the race to fame, blowin pass the pit stops
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
Yeah Nick cop but he aint never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
Its kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin
And tell them niggas this is Nicks spot
They dont keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh?
Im hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh?
Reached to do it and realized his dick stuck
It aint as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then well say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
Im trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin em hos
The concept you dont grasp, Im guessin you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and its praise I be receiving
From the night befo, at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin right outside since these niggas wont let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that niggas the next to win
Virgina gon rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth degree, Tennekey, T-Dot to the country yall
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal
I aint ashamed, my city aint on the map
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they aint born to rap
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here aint trynna hear that
Cause Im on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5s
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
This cant be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Krogers just to get they money stacked
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think its funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin where the money at?!
It aint as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then well say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
Im trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin em hos
The concept you dont grasp, Im guessin you too old

Unless youre down to do this publicly
Girl you know you, know you gotta get comfortable

Gold-digging-ass bitches, fuck em then its fuck em all

Strap on, clip bent, riding in the Cadillac 
Jack boys looking at me, and they know I aint having that 
Let them niggas pump you up, Like you just had an asthma attack
Ill hit you with that rat-a-tat, change your mind like Matter fact
Bow! We just like the Mafia , body you
Break the code of silence, nigga, we gon Luminati you 
Pull up in that black thing, Phantom of the Opera 
We be selling fish scales, just to make tilapia 
I be up all night, chasing down them Benjamins
You should see this money, all these pretty hoes Im swimming in
Walking to the stage, singing Not Afraid by Eminem
Take me to the boss, bitch, I dont deal with middlemen 
Im about whatever, man, fuck what they talking about
Their opinion doesnt count, we the only thing that matters

Awww, man, I love my team, man, I love my team 
Ill die for them niggas, awww 
If Omelly tell me, Fuck her, Ima fuck her 
And if my nigga like her, swear to God that I wont touch her 
Cause loyalty is everything, them niggas like my brothers
If you dont see me with them everyday
Most likely I dont trust em, so its fuck em
Im a northsider nigga , with a southsider attitude 
Got the streets already, now Im coming to take the avenues 
Broke—them niggas love you
You get money, they get mad at you 
Like why Tip aint sign you yet?
Cause I aint never ask him to 
Haaaa! Just look at my wrist 
You look like that and I look like this 
Im looking Rozayish and you looking like Chris 
Old played-out-ass nigga, hating on me, broke bitch

DJ Ill Will
More than just your wifeys favorite DJ
Hes yours too

I dont know how to talk to you
I dont know how to ask you if youre okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like theyre just happier than us these days, these days
I dont know how to talk to you
I dont know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as the expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just dont understand it
No, Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just dont understand it
I dont know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still cant get across to you
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as the expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
But baby, dont get it twisted
You was just another player on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didnt they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you could have it
You needed me
Oooh, you needed me

Check, look
And I aint tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor tell me whats happenin
I am drinkin XO D is sippin some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again return of the mack again
Deceiving was cool Ill never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin one of my rapper friends
I dont wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me
Little me
Pay attention I guarantee you itll be
One of the best, decisions youve made
Im sonnin them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit
I am talkin all day shoppin sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
Hear me, Treys girl? Go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a tracks demise
I will kill this song til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I wont say Im the best til the stats arrive
And all these a-list parties you fraternize
Where you cant wear hats inside its only slacks and ties
But you dont never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best
When I give ya what I give ya
When I give ya what I give ya
It aint a women in the world that can doubt that 
I need a women not a girl cause Im bout that 
And when I give ya what I give ya
When I give ya what I give ya
It aint a women in the world that can doubt that 
I need a women not a girl cause Im bout that 
And when I give ya what I give ya
Yup its me again, Songz with a z again
Canadian visitor, lady exhibitor
Play me Ill visit ya
Lay you in critical, condition
So dont get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin with a fly face, slim waist, big butt
Thats why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos now we got the city froze
Somethin like my wrist be
Niggas know how this shit be
Step into the club security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor they give us a couple sips free
I be on Hennessy, straight, no cubes
Take me where the women be, I wont lose
Drake take Patron to the face til he wasted
Im blowin til Im gon outta space in the Matrix
Call me Mr. Anderson huh
Im ramblin
But at the same time Im spittin a flame rhyme
Baby whats your name? They call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen its game time
We could take a couple shots break down ya ds
Take it to the hole post up on me
Let me fill the arena, Ill be Gilbert Arenas
Somethin like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya
When I give ya what I give ya 
When I give ya what I give ya 
It aint a woman in the world that can doubt that 
I need a woman not a girl cause Im bout that 
And when I give ya what I give ya 
When I give ya what I give ya 
It aint a woman in the world that can doubt that 
I need a woman not a girl cause Im bout that 

I tell her now gon pop that pussy for a real nigga
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
Im in Hells Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord is my witness
So on my Libra scale, Im weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hoola hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, Im dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters cant see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I aint jump yet
But Im, Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby its real
And I say I aint doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she wont but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
I tell her go on! Pop that pussy for me
Haters cant see me but bitches still looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
Im all about I give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that wine and dine
Try to check me and Imma have em checkin pulses
They say choose wisely thats why I was chosen
Rocking like the asphalt, its the cashs fault
Looked in the face of death and took its mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girls face South and her ass North
But Im Ray Charles to that bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby its real
And I say I aint doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she wont but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Pandemonium, she cause that
Toss it up, and I stuff em where her draws at
Thats on everything like feets thats on my floor mats
Red bottoms, spikes on em, thats dos stacks
Speakin Spanish while she tannin, body no fat
Shawty body body got me on my 4th stack
Pink champagne, order Moet
Rollin airplanes, where I land at?
I levitate over numbers you niggas never make
The Columbians callin, I tell em perate
Every summer I celebrate with a new estate
Lets get the fuck out this club, call it the great escape
She wrap her lips round a nigga, just like a chinchilla
Crap table Bellagio, Im a big tipper
My life a stage I need her just to stand on it
Every time she look back, I toss a band on it
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby its real
And I say I aint doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she wont but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will

Baby girl whats this about
Invite me in and kick me out
Theres better ways to deal with this
Does it offend you that Im real as shit
Aint another dude as tough you feel me
I mean who love you like I love you really
Whats up with this distancing
I dont feel significant
Hold up wait girl hold just a min
I need this moment just to vent
Incidents I cant control
Came up out I had to go
You knew I was coming back
You wanted that I had to grow
Said you could get past my past
So what we moving backwards for
Who knew it would take this long
You never mentioned that before
How could you diss me this me
Kiss me dismiss me just leave
Bitch we history mystery
Haunts me how you smile dont miss me
Want me need me call me
Deeply heal me hear me touch me see me feel me
See she guilty look away
Crooked love cant look my way
Took a day to write you this
For night you miss in light of this
Cuz I made it despite of this
Lets make a night of this
Fire lit glass of wine relax your mind we passin time
Ashes from the passions of our past just fly
And its fine
Damn its time to accept it I never hear your voice again
Its so hard to say goodbye but thats what turns boys to men
The choices in
Life never seem fair
But they bring light to the things never seen there
So at least for the time that it took
When you climb and you look
You done made it to the clean air
Breathe in enjoy it cuz some seek joy just to destroy it
Distorted visions dont playback the way they were recorded
Why cant sometimes life be edited minus all the bullshit
Get a full grip fast forward through the open road
When life push your buttons you dont seem to have remote control
I hope that your soul is safe
I hope all your goals in place
I hope that it goes away and everything just goes your way
I hope when foes oppose you they get stuck with the frozen face
I hope I can motivate somebody to grow today
I hope that you go hard and even though things dont go your way
Hold up wait
Even though you broke my heart
Im still wishing you the best
Im just gonna play my part
If someones willing to invest
This has been my blood
This has been my tears
This is been a pain I felt inside my heart for years
I been workin so hard I know they gotta feel the bars
This aint bout no girl this bout the deal I lost
Yeaaa,ey yo check this out
I like to dedicate this song to…
All my failures in life
Everything that I ever endured that just made me stronger…
It made me realize that
Its not the end, its not where it stops
Anybody could do it…LETS GO!!!

Please
D-d-d-d-damn what did I consume
Something spinnin fast either me or its the room
I bet you its the room, cause I dont do no drugs
Or maybe its that tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way Im throwed and I am on a mission
So if your ears a virgin Id advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isnt kosher and this shit isnt Christian
Its that motherfuckin heat you can find up in the kitchen
Baby holla at your nigga, I got that shit for low
Okay maybe I dont but guarantee someone I know
Wait let me slow it down Im gettin ahead 
Plus its gettin hot so Im a take a seat instead 
Im lucky I aint dead Im on a rollercoaster ride yall
We all of age and I aint got nothin to hide yall
And in this game Im a tidal when the tides small
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb
Every record that Ive done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin me Im the one and I havent even made it
Maybe Im hearing things cause Im feeling like Im faded
Im feelin like Im faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
Im feelin like Im faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I just set the 40 ups, and I got two blunts
Bagging sour diesel, stinking like I got a few stumps
I’m sipping on lean, while you got fruit punch
Getting faded like clothes, I’ve been washed too much
Man, smoking with the devil got me high as an angel
Blow a smoke ring over my head, it’s a halo
Wake up, and bake up, spend the whole day slow
Head in the clouds, but my face low
Ayo, I got them percocets, you want a percocet?
Yo girl got some nice titties, yeah, a perky set
I purchase cess ‘cause everyday I work with stress
High while I’m driving, it’s like I’m triyn’ to work a jet
And I smoke like a choo-choo train
So I stay low-key like Ja Rule new name
And I can barely walk, but it’s all good and dandy
Man, I’m so high I need a pilot to land me
Every record that Ive done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin me Im the one and I havent even made it
Maybe Im hearing things cause Im feeling like Im faded
Im feelin like Im faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
Im feelin like Im faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded

Man, you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you aint use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
Thats a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
Ill wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
And love, I dont mind feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If its over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that Im on and who is in your past
Im in the fresh and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, Imma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of thats ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class Im teaching
Cause guaranteed Imma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And Im the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
Im two floors under but my rooms sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you dont wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before Ill grab that for ya like holding a door
Cause mine is Polo, and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
Cant let you go
Cant let you go
I cant let you go
You were late to school
Im gonna have to see you after class

Someones gonna have to straighten you right out

Someones gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someones gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
You can call me professor
But baby you broke the rules
You wont get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
So you can work it off
Baby I can give you extra credit
But theres something else
Girl can I frisk you?
Search you body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
Its cause your hiding ?
And Im going to sentence you
Baby you can do your time on me
I cant let you go

You were late to school
Im gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someones gonna have to teach you a lesson

Who else really trying to mess with Hollywood Cole
Im with Marley G though
Treating Birmingham just like my Hollywood shows
Im trying to tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
Thats why I pick and choose, I dont get shit confused
I got a small circle, Im not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Dont like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
I live fast die young, never take it slow
Tell your girl to tell a friend that its time to go
And tell me todays weather
I know they say they good, but trust me Im better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
Im cold but still hot you cant decide on a sweater
Really its whatever
I am murdering and this is so amusing
If theyre a sight to see then I am an illusion
I tell you Im the man baby what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me, someone hit the snooze then
And keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
Im headed for the moon, I aint bout to hit the ceiling
Im about to hit the club, women tell me Im appealing
But fuck what they say let me tell you how Im feeling
Im drinking
These London street lamps got a real glow
Dizzy playing driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he a hater, baby, he dont know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I aint lying to the kids like the dentist aint scary
Im what Lebron was to Saint Vincent, Saint Marry
But I aint playing high school games
Pullin McLarence through a McDonalds drive through lane
Im to fly, I keep it hip hop like Afu-Ra
Baby girl on that Mclaren
You gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords
I do it better than the best could

Whipping the chevy, still getting my tipped licked
When Im ready I still fall off intheparty like confetti
Its still mad rappers, D. Dot Angelettis
Still just as skinny as you met me
Still keep it real, never will let another disrespect me
For real, til deep in peace they rest me
Still smoke cess cause I swear that they stress me
And when Im home a lot, keep the chrome a lot
Cause even when Im home Im knowin there aint a lot of dudes
That dont like the fact Im blowin
Like some running shoes on the track Im goin
Tell these other dudes they slack Im sewin
Dont get hemmed up, I think Timmed up
Cause in my mind its the winter time all the time
Im a grind
Tell em Im a rhyme, told em that this sing got me signed
Try to put me in a box I will not stay there
And if I fall I will not lay there
Grown man, this is not daycare
A big boy game, they do not play fair
But I still keep it trill and I got this chair
Still uncomfortable if cops is there
My fam still dysfunctional, we not repaired
Still got rhymes out the asshole
Still wonder why are they mad for
Cause Im in the hood like the crack-ho diesel
Ask yo people, Trey still do it for the people
Ride with some inter straps your whole fucking car is illegal
Still pick good over evil
Still play the Jesus and its wild cause Im still sinning
Addiction still weed-puffin, giving it to women
Its still my brain ready to bust up out my skull
To the mic, cause my mouth to be saying shit right
They saying shit like, I dont be killing it
You niggas is ridiculous, eat a dick or some syphilis
Die slow, still I done sucked it up
Drake tell em what the fuck is up
I used to cut the porch lights on
And now I cut the Porsche lights on
Just to let em know their foresights wrong
Where this nigga going with that obscure ice on
He a lame, Im tryna get my mature life on
I asked what happen, or whats hattenin, hattenin
Hop up out the passenger and help me back the phantom in
Damn, I never got to use that in a convo
Never got the chance to put you back in a condo
And, and, it couldnt be more true
I always meant to get you that villa in Corfu
Women I pass off, and money I tore through
Now all I really need is the number before 2
Is it over, tell me it isnt over
They told me it was easy as I get a little older, yeah right
And this is what my life outro sound like
Even though Dre did it this shit dont sound right
I was, born to do it, born to make bomb music
I flow tight like I was born Jewish
Well, actually I was born Jewish
I guess at this point you could say I was born foolish 
Yea, what about the grammys and the bubbly
What about all my fans that be loving me, I
Used to chill in them spots where the trouble be
But never ended up in that menage at the Double Tree
What about that girl Rita down in Basque
In L.A Swear I would of never cheated on your ass

Situation got me thinking and thats when I got to writing, hmm...

Pretty women are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all just disappear right now
Look, youre gettin all your friends and youre gettin in the car

Nails done, hair done, every thing big
Nails done, hair done, everything big
You gettin ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spendin hours in salons on your hairstyle
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin 10 pounds preparin for summer
And you don’t do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you’re the fuckin coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart
I’ve always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together
She got it all together
She dont need to help none
She got her own paper
She dont need you to taker her
On a shopping spreee
My girl is fancy, fly and free
For some Gucci, huh
For some Louis huh
She got the best of everything
You can never report a fancy girl like me
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
Wave em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let em know that everything big

Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And aint nobody realer, and aint nobody realer, go
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we’ll spend it together
I’m down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don’t even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it

Ringing like a telethon

First single got me banned from America

Slave to the pussy, but I’m just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking about me going platinum in a year again
Don’t I got that shit the world, wanna hear again?
Don’t Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows just bore me, paint drying
I’m never tripping over anything that aint mine
I’m hearing the shit that you say through the grape vine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It’s been that way from the beginning
I just been playing I didnt notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear

Southern Smoke
This another one from your boy V-O
Im gon tell the people, that we locking this down

I can easily make them admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they dont like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I cant lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and its obvious of who cant tell
And no, this aint Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam L

I cant believe that its just really you and me, and I know

Only see the truth when Im staring in the mirror
Lookin at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I aint tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know Im the man with it, uh
With the bands like I mustve went to Clark, went to Hampton
I aint playin with it
I aint felt the pressure in a little while
Its gonna take some getting used to 
Floatin all through the city with the windows down
Puttin on like I used to 
They never told me when you get the crown
Its gon take some getting used to 
New friends all in their old feelings now
They dont love you like they used to, man
When you get to where the fuck Im at
You gotta remind em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I aint never spent
When they say youre too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind em about where Im from
Not about where Im going, about where Ive gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in 87
Lord, tell em bitches I aint got no times to play games with em
I aint got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
Im fuckin her mind

Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin thats B-roll, bitch
I aint felt the pressure in a little while

Lets just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin like a damn cyborg, weighin 224
Oh man, these boys dont even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together—motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yesterday I fell in love
Today feels like my funeral
I just got hit by a bus, shouldnt have been so beautiful
Dont know why I gave my heart, gave my trust
Gave everything, you think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
Id do something different, make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep making the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
Im sitting here tryna keep my composure
Knowing inside Im broken and tore up
She got me gone, Im on her like a drug
I try to go but end up wanting more
Stuck in my head, vivid as a picture
I wanna be clean but I cant get rid of her
Uh, give my all, you take it from me 
And dont even replace it for me 
I wish youd just fake it for me 
I wish I can make you love me more
You cant tell I fucks with you, I needed you
I thought that you understood that based on how I treated you
I dont pay attention to the rumors that you feed into
Know youre missin somethin, I wish I was what completed you
 Damn
Yesterday I fell in love
Today feels like my funeral
I just got hit by a bus, shouldnt have been so beautiful
Dont know why I gave my heart, gave my trust
Gave everything, you think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
Id do something different, make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep making the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
Im sitting here tryna keep my composure
Knowing inside Im broken and tore up
She got me gone, Im on her like a drug
I try to go but end up wanting more
Stuck in my head, vivid as a picture
I wanna be clean but I cant get rid of her
Uh, I feel like a killer hit me 
The weapon was concealed initially 
But I felt so much pain from it 
You deserved to feel it with me more
I feel like I beg with you, I plead with you
I dont comprehend how you cant love when its so easy to
I thought you could do it, I believed in the naive in you 
I just need to breathe, baby now I got the freedom to
Shes like a drug, yeah
And I dont think I can get rid of her 
Cause she got me in this curse 
And then it dawned on me
I cant do nothing with her 
This womans worth 
I cant find my way out and it hurts 
I tried but she wont let me go 
She won’t let me go 
She wont let me go
She wont let me go
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

Shoutout to King of the Dot and OVO one time
For flying out Jet Li on a Learjet ‘cause Lil Romeo must die
My last battle was Battle of the Bay 5
That was 5 years ago when I was ‘yay’ high
I feel paranoid on a yay high
‘Cause with these cameras, this host, and this little pussy…
Am I on Dateline?
I could kill you in six seconds: I should just make Vines
Let’s save time, just say “time!”
He’s probably gon say some Asian shit
And pull out shoguns, Peking Duck, Ching Chang Chong
Wait, slow that down, did I accidentally diss you?
I said pull out yo guns, peek and duck, ching chang chong
That shit is easy as fuck, I don’t like to slow it down
When I spit a line, I want y’all to know it now
You always over-explain
That shit is overly done, ain’t y’all over it yet?
Ironic, the shortest motherfuckers always tryna go over your head
How you that small?
You look like a male Bratz doll
You know I actually auditioned for Wild N Out
Then I looked in the mirror and said, “That’s not what I’m about.”
They had me rhyme in a Chinese accent
I told em I’m from Korea town
Then they asked the black guy next to me to wear a wig and a Madea gown, y’all know him as Conceited now
You’re a D-list celebrity, I’d rather keep my integrity
I’d make more money in my sleep while you sleep with the enemy
I couldn’t have bought my condo with Con dough
I got Dumb money—and that’s not a pun, dummy
Now I got young money for the artist fee
And you also got young money for modeling the cover of Carter 3
Look at his baby ass with his baby tats
You buy your guns at Baby Gap
Your first job, you babysat
When you throw out punches they feel like baby daps
Your favorite rapper is Baby Bash
That’s not a punchline, that’s real… baby facts
Listen here, Dumbfoundead
Now you going against the hoodie type
The gun’ll spit, give you a bunch of tips
I ain’t talking about good advice
Nigga you ain’t cookin me, the only thing you cook is rice
Aight, which one of y’all Dumbfoundead
Both of you niggas look alike
So y’all finally put Dumbfoundead in front of me
They say you are what you eat
No wonder why this cat kept duckin me
Nigga, me and this Chin shoulda been battled
I woulda served ya and flamed ya
Dont think that the Dot is determined to save ya
‘Cause they gave me the body I always wanted
Like a personal trainer
So I’ll pull up on that set you rep
Get your stomach cut without doing sit-ups
You better dip, it won’t work out
If I spot you with the pounds that I lift up
When the MACs out you ain’t doing squat
Y’all better see Dumb bail when I send this Chin up
This kid Dumb is the worst dressed in battle rap history
I mean I hate your shoes, b
You only roll in somethin fresh when you makin sushi
And what you wear doesn’t match
Like the lips and words in Asian movies
Y’all move y’all mouths a million times for just one word
And it still be off—why?
They be like, “...........Hi.”
The sound effects never on time either
It’s either like kshch or huhhuhkpshpsh
But try that kung fu shit with me, I’ma grip the 8
You don’t want me to cook your noodle
Well, get low, mane, like what’s on your dinner plates
Don’t believe anything this ninja say
Or one word he spit today
‘Cause just like your YouTube clip
We know everything you kickin fake
This nigga’s name is Jonathan Park
That’s not a punchline, that’s real facts!
No cab when you see an arm wave
You can get hit with the knife
But a toastll spread when I give Park, K’s
I’ll show up at your front door with a large 8
Right where John stay, it’ll be lookin like Monopoly
‘Cause I got the metal piece at Park place
You will get wet—grab a poncho, nigga!
I point with the 9 like Rondo, nigga
And you gonna hear a lot of steel like I’m a Toronto nigga
How you say that kick video was fake? That shit was real
It’s as real as you grip the steel
If I can’t kick it, yo, your bitches will
Theres perks to being short, I don’t care what y’all think
When you got small feet, you can get the Jordans all cheap
When you order a shot at the bar, that’s a tall drink
He got three hot tubs at the crib, all sinks
I know these short jokes are getting old
But I ain’t even gotta use those
They’re just starting to grow on me, but you won’t
So I had some of my North Korean homies hack into your emails
I found some very interesting details
Keywords like latex, shaved legs, jpegs of Taye Diggs
All types of gay shit
But I know you ain’t gay, ‘cause you into Asians
But yours look like cavemen
I stay with a bad bitch, what you think is a dime is maybe, ehhh, 6
Like, if you went to a Thai whore house
They be last pick and have dicks
I get the top hoes at the Brothel
You couldn’t reach the top row at a Costco’s
It’s impossible, you’re hella short
You, Emmanuel Louis, Gary Coleman, Martin Lawrence
Lil Bow Wow, Big Bow Wow, and Kevin Hart
Black Hollywood’s seven dwarves
A bunch of midgets in the woods living large
You seem all tough in Hollywood
But it’s all an act in the end like Bollywood
When I’m talking K pop, I ain’t talking Gangnam Style
I’m talking Gangland files
In L.A. words can get you killed like a hangman round
Lately the battle scene has gotten Iggy Azalea
But I ain’t talking black and white
I’m talking make-believe and actual life
Hear how you glorifying guns and probly gon have a blast tonight
There’s some kid in every major city in America who’s gon get blast tonight
You have imaginary guns
Some people have mandatory ones
I seen them Wild N Out reruns of you rapping having fun
The homie died the other day, the news ain’t ran the story once
Sometimes I think we both forget that we both sell rhymes
But hook us up to a polygraph, bet I won’t fail mine
With your folktales of dope sales, ain’t no shells flyin
‘Cause real rounds don’t end when the host yells Time!
You and your whole Asian gang, I’ll just use one fist to hit ya
I’ll put my right hand on that yellow circle: that’s Twister, nigga
Double deuce-deuces with these little blickers
I’ll grip the trigger, you could get shot down by the twins
More than Roger in Sister Sister
I’m quick to grip a Wesson or a 12
I’ll let the weapon give you hell
Just like your fortune cookies you can get the message from a shell
You cuff your bitch like she in jail, but she give me mad choch
Yeah, you’re part of the Swim Team, I give her back strokes
She give me fast throat, and do good when she south
Since she eat with chopsticks, she should be used to having some wood in her mouth
But she has the flattest ass and chest I have ever seen
Shes such a small skeezer
If I was you I wouldn’t be wrestling to hit that raw neither
I mean shes from China, why would you take her?
No matter what she rock, nothing big shows
From any angle that John seen her
This large nina make sure your nephew and niece are slaughtered
And your aunt may find your uncle been killed like Peter Parker
Nigga, the clip will be on your head, you don’t need a barber
And that shit will “BOW!” like you when you greet your father
I’ll kick in his door, walk in his home
Start wavin like I’m finna go
When I’m lickin ain’t no envelope
I’ma hit your sensei, your grandfather, I’ma kill your folks
I’ma bring the Maggie to that yellow family like the Simpsons show
Y’all niggas know I’m gonna sling him
Them 9’s I’ma bring him
And I bring the war to Park like Wild Water Kingdom
I’m bringin the heavy can
Any problems, I’ll let the semi blam
If things go south, Park, soon as you walk I’ll
Make sure you get caught, man, how can he stand?
Y’all catch that? Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, Stan?
Man, that’s why this chinky hates me
If it’s problems I’ll get the shit jumpin like Mr. Hanky
Now lastly they told me
By the looks of his eyes he might be sleepin on you
So I better come with it, I should be scared of his freestyles
And be horrified of Dumbs writtens
Had me like, “Shit, in this battle, Dumbfoundead gonna cook and eat me…” nah, just kiddin
SLOW IT DOWN! I JUST DISSED YOU!
I said, Dumbfoundead gonna cook and eat me? Nah, just kittens
HAHH!!!
I’m opening up for Pat Stay and Charron, shake my head
I started this nerdy shit, this the motherfuckin thanks I get?
I get the club going up like iLoveMakonnen
You get in the club droppin names like, “I’m with Nick Cannon.”
He rocks expensive shit and licks his lips, LL Cool J over here
Difference is you’ve been rappin about dudes your whole career
By the way, what’s all that shit on your neck?
What’s all that shit mean?
Oh, I get it, we all make mistakes when we’re fifteen
This is where me, Tunechi and Wiz link
We got grown-man tats, lil tyger, that shit is kid ink
How much work could they done on you?
Matter of fact, that’s the only time you’ve had a gun on you
Ratatatat butterflies on your back
And some Chinese letters that don’t mean jack
Every battle you do is a short film
Oh, you got unlimited ammo?
Does that mean I could have force fields?
Does that mean I could have orcs, swords, shields
A giant hammer that Thor wields?
Does that mean I could have orbs, pills
Potions to level up more skill?
Just ‘cause you talk about guns doesn’t make it more real
You’re a dork still!
While you and your crew were playin Gangster: The Gathering
I went on a couple dates with your family
Met his mama on Tinder, thought we had something special
I leaned in to kiss her
She said “SLOW IT DOWN! I JUST MET YOU!”
So I holla’d at his auntie, real polite, real respectful
I thought she’d want me
But she said: “SLOW IT DOWN! THAT’S MY NEPHEW!
My last resort was his sister, I knew I’d be successful
I was like, all aggressive with it, like, “Let me hit it!”
She said: “SLOW IT DOWN! I’MA LET YOU!”
It’s funny how you think Organik is your friend
But he’s just exploiting you, he’s like Nick Cannon at the end
Yo, but after this, I may never have to battle rap again
But you, you’ll be back up here again
Battling with him, battling with them
Battling with enemies, battling with friends
Wait, what’s your name, sir? Jim? You’ll be battling with Jim!
For you, it’s a never-ending battle and the battle never ends
The end.
We was supposed to battle 2009 in Grind Time
With the bars you ran, so what we need relay for?
You was pissed, I was buzzin
If we battled, you would be a corpse
So that shows I been made John mad in ’09 like EA Sports
I mean I thought you would sign a deal
You mad ‘cause my views are climbin mills?
I know that shit was drivin him crazy
Like when you behind the wheel
I shoot and fire steel that’ll pop at ya
And I light 8 sticks like it’s Hanukkah
Just to get you capped like a yarmulke
That erase this mark like a swastika
I load and flash steel: that’s photographers
And the can it’ll cap it all like Ottawa
Yo, I’m boxin ya, if we brawl up in this place
You’ll get knuckles all up in ya face
And your head be knocked-off like the Jordans that y’all make
So y’all go and gave me this Chino in TO
Who eats soup named miso, and he’s called a hero?
Nigga, I will take every dollar you got if your gwap got zeroes
Like that movie they was shooting, Heat
Al Pacino’s in the cast and Rob De Niro
SLOW IT DOWN! I JUST DISSED YOU!
I said we’re shooting heat
I’ll put Chinos in a cast and rob dinero
You take this Asian pride shit so far
Your favorite battle rapper is probably Math
I mean there’s nothin left to talk bout
You’re so Asian, when you get hungry, you argue with your girl on purpose so she can put you in the dog house
You take this Asian pride shit so far, you probably love Ryu
And your second favorite battle rappers Tsu Surf
‘Cause he puts his rhymes in subtitles
I should let the snub light you right now
You’ll let the pipe blaow? Nigga, pipe down!
You ain’t got the Magnum for protection to pop Con, Dumb
It’s not in your lifestyle
I need you to tell me right now
Why do you use “R’s” instead of “L’s” when you speak?
He be like, “Herro! My favorite rapper is Ril Wayne.”
I mean, now that’s the truth, I ain’t racist
I don’t know if that’s somethin you do ‘cause you’re Asian
But in this battle I’ll give you a L so you can use it in your language
That Ruger get to bangin
Put you in your place if you comin for Con dough
Go realer with the bananas
For the monkey business wherever Con go
Why would you think a 9 would miss?
Bullets have no name, but they still comin for John though
Y’all know S.O.N.S. created a lane for any battler that has bars
Even when you Asians will break
And somebody down and killin em, that’s ours
No, when you Asians will break
And somebody down and killin em, that’s SARS
So even if he did say he’ll burn me like ether when he busts guns
These blickers kick back like 3 Ninjas
You Rocky? Put the Colt to your tum tum
And if you did have a gun, you would give nobody the bucks

Yall ready to have some fun?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh? 
Go, a go head 
Go, a go, go head 
A go, go, go, go, go, go head
A go, go, go, go, go, a go head
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh? 
Nail done, hair done, everything did 
Na-na-nails done, hair done, everything did 
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh? 
Nail done, hair done, everything did
Na-na-nails done, hair done, everything did 
Oh, you fancy, huh?
LA, let me see your hands
Telling that the night 
And she bought it, let em know that everything big
Nails done, hair done, everything big 
All my LA girls, let me see your hands 
New years eve you can leave up and bring a friend
And she bought it, let em know that everything big
Nails done, hair done, nails done, hair done
All my LA girls, let me see your hands 
All my LA girls 
All my LA girls 
All my LA girls 
All my LA girls 
All my LA girls 
All my LA girls
Let em know that everything big 
Nails done, hair done, nails done, hair done
Finally back in Toronto, its better here
I just wanna be anywhere but everywhere
Im being lazy at the crib kushin it up
I get enough exercise just pushing my luck
Sitting back thinking, damn, where did they go?
They used to be the ones to watch Ricki Lake show
And now I see em picking up the pieces
One too many starting over speeches
I guess, it’s back to me like it always was
Me and the OVO set like it always was
A little money on the counter I left for my girl
With a note I’m trying to see the rest of the world
It all looked so amazing when we are growing up
Used to sit back and say I know I’ll get a model one day
But all the money and the rap game slow as fuck
And all the models from the hood, Project Runway
Yeah, it’s whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
But it’s evident that nothing can prepare us for certain moments that you just gotta cherish
Like this young girl had my lyrics tatted on her arm last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with, yeah
Feel like I been here before, huh?
Yeah, I still got ten years to go, huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh? 
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Na-na-nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh? 
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Na-na-nails done, hair done, everything did 
Oh, you fancy, huh?
All my LA girls
This go out to all my LA girls
I said, all my LA girls

I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Cant allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they wont skip me
I am the last hope. Dont hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
Im on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope
Can you imagine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker, watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the South
Niggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk, I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher than leather
So we can keep on hold it forever
My names Kardinall
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Cant allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they wont skip me
I am the last hope. Dont hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
Im on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope
Jealousy is something I havent felt in years
Theres nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, Im incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if its edible
They say the futures always for-seen
Thats why Im steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em cause he wont let no other niggas write for em
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The names Drake and I dont take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause Im taken advantage man
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Cant allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they wont skip me
I am the last hope. Dont hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
Im on the front line with my weapon

Thats the wrong thing
Thats the wrong thing to
Thats the wrong thing to do
Thats the wrong thing
Thats the wrong thing to
Thats the wrong thing to do
I turned a blind eye
Let the borders get wavy
Nothing touches me lately
Shouldnt I be having fun?
Thats the wrong thing to
Thats the wrong thing to do
Its hard to define
When my memorys hazy
Everyones trying to save me
Cant they see Im having fun?
Thats the wrong thing to
Thats the wrong thing to do
Somethings wrong, but I choose to be naive
Cant tell no one what it means to me
Somethings wrong, but I choose to be naive
And the longer that I leave it, I can feel it taking over me
Shy away and hide out
When its calling me out
When its weighing me down
Ill play it down
When all the trouble Ive found
Comes back around
If its catching me now
Thats the wrong thing
Ill play it down
Thats the wrong thing to
Thats the wrong thing to do
Somethings wrong, but I choose to be naive
Cant tell no one what it means to me
Somethings wrong, but I choose to be naive
And the longer that I leave it, I can feel it taking over me
Somethings wrong, but I choose to be naive
Somethings wrong, but I choose to be naive
Thats the wrong thing
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
I play it down
Thats the wrong thing
Thats the wrong thing
Thats the wrong thing
Thats the wrong thing
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
I play it down
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
I play it down
Cant they see
Thats the wrong thing

Now hopefully live to see what they say that Im gon be
And if not then I hope future does in the memory of me
Get your team in order, assembly is key
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet than to be
On the stand jeopardizing an inch of their loyalty
Pick a lane, pick a lane, thats all I ever heard
But Im just trying to swerve, without hitting the curb
Thats why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them
And take photos with hater niggas and crop them
I am not them, I photoshop them out

There’s no copies of the key
Homie, that’s a guarantee
Don’t forget that Fendi purse that you put all your cash in
Kinda hard to concentrate when cameras are flashin’
Other dudes would suffocate her, I don’t want her gaspin’
Don’t know where she’s going
And I do not plan on asking at all

My connection with niggas that wanna fight
Over women, thats not right

Dont put it past them
I dont think that they understood
My friends they aint even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
Lately I dont know about the friends that I hang with
Im nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on Pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
Robbing r&b singers, specially if they know where the keys at
Specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is
Thats how niggas puttin they dirt down
Streets are seedy, I call em sesame
Its Ernie and Berts town
specially when these youngins get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same placell get burnt down
Coincidink? not likely not a chance
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
At least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
A lot of people only play they part when they spittin
But I dont think that they understood
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
I took the ivory way in and yes Im glad that keenan could
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
Uh
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good

Uh-huh

WHOOOOOOOO! Another one, Rodney
Thats girls number one, finally standing up for herself sayin...

Same dudes used to laugh at me
See me in the CL 6 with Haffa B
They know that money begets money so naturally
Me and Haffa could blow a couple of stacks hassle free
Im like fuck yall haters on behalf on me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
Im talking me and two part -ners in that Caprice
With no copies made I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mould you rappers like plasticine
I have to dream, but dog
Me and success are two things you dont wanna find your ass between
Back against the wall like a plasma screens
The inside of my wallet is pasture/ past your green
And you are now hanging with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene
I should leave Earth, nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and ery night is New Years
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and Im coming with two spears
Im telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up making executives calls
And with me, women be building these sceptical walls
But once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all, uhh
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression its forever blue
Cheer up baby you dont see all this revenue?
I started the game at level two
Im sayin
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market
I parallel the Flying +Spur+ +Tony park+ it
And its cool if you spill suttin its only carpet
Thats why I get my interior colour only dark shit
Torontos where you livin today
And you aint making records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move, sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints that Im giving away

I remember, being young, dumb, looking for the next thrill
Angry adolescents, three things on our minds
Money, murder and you
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
Bring yo girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it
Picture perfect, uh huh
And I paint a perfect picture, my intentions to get richer
But I aint tryna split the profit with ya
Every pocket on me bleeds, Im a selfish ass nigga
Mmm, deuces up, black coupes is us 
Or maybe the white on white, Ku and Klux
Head all in the bathroom
Beg for it, Ill be back soon
Fuckin problem, fuck your problems
I got my own but one aint a dollar
I got five phones for five different reasons
London, Tasha, Mya, Keisha
Courtney, blue-eyed devils with no Visas
Overseas, high heels, wine and pizza
Overdosed on bad bitches, I swear
One on both arm but need two pair, I beast
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
Bring yo girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it
Yeah ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Vacad in Atlanta, then she goin back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a nigga dont exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, Im Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz-is-to-Me-Just-a-Car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow, mmm
Kill em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Dont get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, Ill do ya, beast
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem

Look, here we go
The first time around
I left the cars at the house and I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go its about the rhyming now
Im seeing it clearer the season is nearer
And still I must change
Im like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but Im outspoken still
They not sure of the work but they all hoping hell
Emerge to victor my words are pictures
And guess the colours so loud that you heard my scripture
With 4 walls give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise Ive been thinking before yall
I barely get tired Im rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week what Im daily required
I meet quotas while you rappers having sleep-overs
Spending nights in the studio trying to beat Hova
Be in the throne instead of being your own
But Look
Im making moves in my city so
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls is steady tryin to get with me though
Important and vital Im caught in a cycle
This is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain it, my effort comes to no avail
Im from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king nigga its the same thing
All day long
But thats a screw face
Rappers befriend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping they slip and trip over your own shoelace
Thats why I tuck em in not giving a fuck again
D.R.A. you add a K.E
A couple mill and you labels cannot play me
I never go broke Im far from a flash in the pan
I am a passionate man, plan it with cash in my hand
Uh
I got few days left
But Imma make use of every single one until every singles done
Until every record is sold, and every string is strung
Tell me take a breather Drake and everything will come
Dog its always been the same
Its all love like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in the driveway
I roll down strips and hose down whips
That when turtle wax up they would close down Richmond
With no down shifting
Haters would say Im adequate
Think I got the type of flow that would make an addict quit
21 years Ive been pimping since being
Repurchased trap music 4 times since then
Seamless transition Im the new fresh prince
Getting pennies for my thoughts
So I put my two cents in
Top of the morning I am dropping the coin in
Plus Im changing the game
You hear me swapping the joint in
They put the fires out and bring the buyers out
And try and box us all together before they buy us out
If they profit from the events we handing flyers out
Then we profit from the attempts to hand desires out
But rich is how we all ending up

Im black and Jewish
Dont be so foolish
Im black and Jewish
Its a Mitzvah
Please dont forget Im black, please dont forget Im Jewish
I play ball like Lebron and I know what a W-2 is
Chilling in Boca Raton with my mensch, Lenny Kravitz
The only purple drink we sip is purple Manischewitz
At my show, you wont simply put your hands in the air
We can also raise a chair or recite a Jewish prayer
Like Baruch Yitadel Yisrael
Veet ha Kim Kardashian Kanye West, amen
I eat Hova with nova, knishes with my bitches
A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy, his name is Weezy
Do not go to Feingolds, though
The pickles are rubber
And I will not be harming ya
I read the Old Testament, okra and matzahball, Ill eat the rest of it
I celebrate Hanukkah, dated Rihannakah
Birth right in Israel, mama from Canada
Daddy from Africa
Best of worlds when youre Jewish with black in ya

Boy Wonder
Drizzy
I get money

I get money

I get girls all different flavors
I buy Gucci, I buy Prada

Yall dont really like me

My flow is sitting right inside the pocket of my pants
I still fly, you cant float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records all you sing ghost
20 thousand for a verse is our routine quote
Im getting rich while you stayin broke
Chillin even if Im in a goose down coat
I cant see you through a Mosley Tribes
So I dont even flinch when you throw me high fives
They try to measure up but there is no one my size
Whatever 40 smoking about to lower my eyes
Beast mode on em, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement I take the flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
I get money

I get girls all different flavors
I buy Gucci, I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar
I get money
I get paper

Bottle after bottle cos the money like so long
Baby... We about to put a show on
Imma show off, like Im supposed to
Yeah you can get lost, I dont know you
I hear my phone ringing when you call
I aint picking up an entertaining them at all
Got your girl face down banging on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
Hmm, hmm, hmmm

Riding with some tags that I got from outta state
Riding with a swag that I got from outta space
Just show me whos the hottest Imma knock em outta place
Call me Homicide Drizzy, Im about to kill your ego
Im about my green, puffin goodie like Im Cee-Lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While a Houston stripper pole dance in a Z-ro
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And yeah, my G-Pass is as valid as can be
Im, Im so fresh the stylist would agree
Waving at your girl while she smiling back at me
I get money

I aint eatin Jacksons when I be in Overtown
Bitch Im eatin lavish, look up, ho, its snowin now

My nigga GDK a goon, hell gun you down
Slid up on him with the stick, yeah and sat him down
My nigga Nut so slick, they aint pat him down

A hundred squares at a time, nigga, hold it down
Addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
Im gettin them stacks, its more addictive than crack
Im addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
Im gettin them stacks, its more addictive than crack
Alright my patience runnin thin
Olympic pools of money, Im just glad I learned to swim
Cannonball, bitch, I hope your diving boards sturdy
And I hope when dinners cold, my niggas do not desert me
Nah, but shits all good
The deal got signed and my splits all good
And these haters pretendin that its all good
Say that shit in person, man I wish yall would
I say you lucky if your father was a figure
Cause my uncle was my father and my father was my nigga
And my mother so proud cause his son is gettin bigger
I took time to load the bullets, now Im bout to pull the trigger
Like boom, boom, boom, Im a genius, god dammit
I aint the type to murder you, Im more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really cant stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Skinny told me to do me
And dont listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would mean that theres a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest couldve fooled me
Yeah, nd to my city Im the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname Starter-Drake
Franchise player, I dont even get a water break
And these other lames is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
Im just chillin in the cut, nigga what, and Im feelin like
Addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
Im gettin them stacks, its more addictive than crack
Im addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that

​No matter what you do, its never enough
​I don’t understand these bitches, Drizzy 
​Trying though, half of these niggas feel me
EarDrummers, Mike WiLL Made-It
They aint never satisfied
​
​
​Time after time after time 
​Moneys all I get and theres still money on my mind
And they aint never satisfied 
And we aint ever satisfied 
And you can make it rain until your arms tired 
As soon as it all stop them bitches just wonder why 
They aint never satisfied
They aint never satisfied 
And they aint ever
Aint no pressure on the money, Lord knows
But we still be on the road like we scared of going broke
We aint never satisfied 
We aint never , we aint never 
And its a lot of money in the room
I gotta find another spot, hiding soon
I mix the rose with the purple juice
I hustle everyday and you dont have a clue
After you get money and all your dreams come true
Its like everything that surround you get brand new
I cant never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Cant let the money and fame come between my crew
My pain still runnin deeper than the ocean
Ordered up 10,000 ones and I throw it
Name a bag in the store that she aint got
Name a designer store that we aint shop
They aint never satisfied
​
​Time after time after time 
​Moneys all I get and theres still money on my mind
And they aint never satisfied

And you can make it rain until your arms tired 
As soon as it all stop them bitches just wonder why

But we still be on the road like we scared of going broke
We aint never satisfied 
We aint never , we aint never 
Yeah, yeah
Theres a lot of money in the room
She said she wanna ball, wanna shoot some hoop

We just out here doing what young niggas do
Me and that boy Future could probably start a group
On some K-Ci and JoJo shit, have these bitches loose
Man, they know what it do
We got these niggas in the game stuck and they shouldnt move
I dont like sudden moves
Tell me, how is it that every fuckin verse get the rewind?
And the watch cost too much for free time
And I hit the strip club, thats my me time
See I cant get much bigger, Im that nigga
But they aint never satisfied
​
​Time after time after time 
​Moneys all I get and theres still money on my mind

Going down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can ride
Check, I wish yall coulda seen me back in high school, backpack
Grey range black Ac
Put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance, Fresh Js, new pants
Back when fuck bitches, get money was the new chant
It started out about a boy like Hugh Grant
Now Im a young man doin things you cant
But you cant call me Champagne Charlie
I campaign hardly
My damn chain glitter ruby red
The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this
I swear that we been through this
Your boyfriends future plans got em on todays to-do list
Cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix
Bingo, money aint a thing ho
That prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
I aint speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
Cause when Im in the spot its popping like Christophers single
If yall dont like me then 
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend Im just sayin man 
They be gettin jealous when you paid, savin everything they made, I keep thinkin that 
Telling people my image is lame, and Im whats wrong with the game, but Im feelin like 
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know
Hey, Im flyer then a motherfucker
Haters wanna see me dead like John Tucker
Im in that big boy 550 s-class
I hit the gas and watch them hoes waving through the glass
Pimp glass im riding new in 2008 
I hit them hoes and send em home, you take em on a date
That white gucci ticker let em know theres money here
I grip the grain and sit on seats thats made of cashmere
5 karats in my ear, you see them hoes jock?
Bitch theres a whole lota rocks up in this powder watch
Im writin letters to the pen for my brother irving
Send him a picture of that drop with me in it swervin
Hotter than a bitch rock, Cooler than some ice cream
Gotta feed myself Im up here living in a dream
My cadillac mean but my 88 a beast
If bein fly against the law bitch call the po-lice
If yall dont like me then 
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend Im just sayin man 
They be gettin jealous when you paid, savin everything they made, I keep thinkin that 
Telling people my image is lame, and Im whats wrong with the game, but Im feelin like 
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know
Stacks on deck, lacs mounted on Ds
I dont trust you so make sure you count it all please
And once its all there, then that put me at ease
And these niggas just mad cause they account is on freeze
Baby pay attention please, Im more coordinated then a dance team
Its my turn, my turn like advance green
My true religion is money, check out the pant seams
I got cash in my palm I call it hand cream
And I just want the paper
My momma trying to go to rome and I just wanna take her
Im tryin to figure what the los angle is like a laker
So I can be on beaches with my niggas in jamaica

They hating cause my swagger at a all time high
Shit its a damn shame homie I dont even try
Get money mofo is all you hear me reply
If yall dont like me then 
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend Im just sayin man 
They be gettin jealous when you paid, savin everything they made, I keep thinkin that 
Telling people my image is lame, and Im whats wrong with the game, but Im feelin like 

Yeah, Ren, M.O.F, Haha
Its Drake man, its Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
Ima have to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO! Southern Smoke!!!
Very few give you that truth, its either they cant do it with lyrics
Or cant do it in spirit, they cancel what they doin
The samples that they usin, cant get through the clearin
Ill handle it since they just cant get you to hear it
My fathers early careerin forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doin what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son, he gon miss you
And plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
Now you lookin for exes, you aint never expect this
You end up doing time, and me, I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, Id be a wasnt
And mommy Imma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
ITS STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
Im just tryna live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
Im just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
This is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool
Question what I been through
I write a verse addressin it
And yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black
And guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered
I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a nigga
Id punch em I couldnt help it
Now Im grown I can say what it is
Its parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus Im Jewish, he dont approve
I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Cause black is black honey, even if hes very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
ITS STRESS MY N!!!
Im just tryna live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
Im just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
Am I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
Like girls with Double Ds, I got a lot on my chest
Theres questions that need to be answered thats not on the test
Instead of starin at quizzes now its models with breasts
And yes, when Im dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
Homie, I probably couldve been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, maybe Peteys assistant
And my mindset is come and get me
Im all alone at home with my mom and grandma and aint nobody runnin with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady
Daughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
And I dont wanna question half the places Nick been

Whats up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, youve been caught up
With them bitches, I dont get it, youre a star, love
You shouldnt have to deal with that
Id never make you feel like that, cause...
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
Thats why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when youre submissive
Passive aggressive when were texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but dont make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation thats lacking in patience
Ive been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
Weve been talking bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that niggas amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, Im in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70s on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You dont even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something Im missing and disappear when Im bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
Thats why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love
I wish you could see

I love me enough for the both of us
Thats why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love
Shoulda spent more nights
Coulda changed your life
We woulda been alright
All these shoulda, coulda, wouldas
In her ear one time
Prolly wastin my time
Cause she heard it all
Cause she heard it all
Girl, I coulda changed your life
But you heard it all
Well Ima say it anyway
Shawty, Im from the city
Where we were never taught to love
You aint gotta be in love to fuck
Girl, Im just tryna say
Im from the city, oh
Where the money makes a difference

Yup!
I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
I suppose, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Drizzy
Aww yeah Trey, I fuckin feel ya
They be starin at the money like its unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me theres nothin realer
Just enough will solve ya problems, too much will kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of yall is still soundin like last year
The game need change and Im the motherfuckin cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, youll hate me
Cause Im the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all thats why I strive for it
Diss me and youll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party I get fly for it
I know that its comin, I just hope that Im alive for it
I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
I suppose, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I want the money, money, money, I want a whole lot of that
Cause all the honeys, they ask me where the dollars at
Where your head at? Tell me bout your scholar cap
Tryna find a way, but you never got a map
Dream chaser, risk taker
No favor, dont hate us
They might want me to drown
Holdin me down but the throne and the crown
Is all I ever wanted, all I ever needed
If Im the only one then dont nobody else believe it
Then keep it a secret and watch me achieve it
Cause I know what I want now!
So if you want the money, if you gotta make it
You the only one and dont nobody else believe it
Then tell em to beat it and watch you achieve it
Sing it if you want!
I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
I suppose, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left somethin in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin wet, she only 52
And 48 hours all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got pod up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantoms leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress is like a dead end
My girl love me but fuck it, my heart beat slow
And right now, the tour bus is lookin like a freak show
And life change for us every single week so
Its good but I know this aint the peak though
Cause I want the—
I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
The oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

Buzzin your body, body to body
You said youre over me, now youre all over me
I know, you know, Im in too deep to let it go
I know, you know, it’s in my nature to get distant
I know its been a year since I left you alone
Unfortunate, I think you know theres somethin missin
But you never say shit, dont know how to take it
Were good on our own, but
I miss being on Wiltshire at your place, and
I drink you under tables, got you misbehavin
Buzzin in your body, body to body
You said youre over me, now youre all over me
Buzzin in your body, body to body

Damn, I thought I had it all figured it out
Especially when it came to relationships and girls
But just when I least expected it
Love, rearranged my whole world
Junior high, played em, high school, played em
College, well, you know, played em
Me and my friends used to laugh about it, how we fade em
Now cupid’s aiming his arrow right there at me
No more nonchalant can I be, with you here staring at me
With the most beautiful eyes that a nigga ever see
You pull an emotional vibe from my soul, look at me
You got my heart beating like my back is filled with batteries
For the first time I’m in love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody what Im feeling
Said for the first time I feel love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody to feel it
Not so fast, Cole got a whole lotta lotto cash
Life of a bachelor, light skinned rapper
Found a top model with a Tahoe ass
With a broad so bad, when she cross your path
You get her outta them jeans you be thinking about rings
Okay she done got your ass

But Im trying to be a G though
So yeah, Im gonna holler, yeah Im gonna call her
But I aint got a leash though
Uh, I put a name on a lease though
Get an extra set of my keys for
I think I might wife it now
But life is foul and you don’t got a free throw
Uh, and so my next move gon have to be my best move
Beside every king is a bad ass queen
So girl lets make this chess move
For the first time I’m in love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody what Im feeling
Said for the first time I feel love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody to feel it
Now baby, baby
You doin things with my heart aint never felt, its so crazy
I agree to acknowledge love if you gonna let it change me
I was so mistaken
Your love like a Bentley coupe, took me out of a Mercedes
Now baby baby, for so long I miss somebody
My heart just couldn’t played with it
I went from not wanting a girlfriend to needing ya lady
I didn’t think Id ever see
Me callin to you, you voice before I go to sleep
For the first time I’m in love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody what Im feeling
Said for the first time I feel love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody to feel it
I ain’t never looked into a woman’s eye worth of fire
Bet I’m feelin while you holdin’ me begging to take you higher
For so long I wasn’t faded, I couldn’t admitted before
But now I see what life’s about, and I’m never goin’ let you go
Girl I’m growin’
I see us growing
I got to tell the world, somebody gotta know
What you done done to me, I gotta let ’em know
For the first time I’m in love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody what Im feeling
Said for the first time I feel love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody to feel it
I’d swore I’d never fall, but I fell
Run and tell all my old hoes
Erase my number, my photos
Uh, baby girl pardon me but
Don’t text, stop calling me
I aint your nigga, don’t bother me
Fuck your Twitter, don’t follow me
My new girl too thorough
Believe it or not, man, she’s all I need
Thought I was a player, R.I.P
Down goes Frazier, call Ali
Lets hit the mall and its all on me
Cause girl you deserve it
If I take this chance and make these plans

I can see it in your eyes, you angry
Regret got shit on what youre feelin now
Mad cause he aint like me

Take a shot for me 
Take a shot for me 
Oh, take a shot for me 
Take a shot for me 

Yo cant hine yeah
Here we Gooo
The 1st time around
I left the cars at the house
And I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go its bout the rhyme-in Now
Im seeing it clearer, the season is nearer
And still I must change, Im like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but Im out spoken still
They not sure itll work but their all hoping
Hell emerge the victim, my words are pictures
And yes the colors so loud that you heard my scripture
With four walls
Give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I been thinkin before yall
I barely get tired, Im rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week is What Im daily required
Im meetin quotas while you rappers having sleep overs
Spending nights in studio try to be Hova
Be in the throne instead of being ya own
But look
Young Check your freestyle
I am fast approachin on the weekend
Its me, Niko, Bryans here, D10
Freestyle shit bout to segway to the verse here we go
Its like Im makin moves in my city though
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls are steady tryin to get with me though
Important and vital
Im caught in a cycle
And this is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain
And my effort comes to no avail
Im from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king
Nigga its the same thing
All day long
But thats the screw face
Rappers will friend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping you trip and slip over your own shoe lace
Thats why I tuck em in not givin a fuck again
D.R.A you add the K.E a hundred grand and you labels can not
Play me
Ill never go broke
Fuck em Im flashin the pan
I am a passionate man
Planted with cash in my hand uhh
Look... I got few days left
And Im a make use of every single one
Untill every singles done and till every record is sold
And till every string is strung
They tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come
Dog... its always been the same
Its all love
Like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in a driveway
I roll down strips and hosed down whips that when turtles wax up
They will close down richmond
With no down shiftin
Haters will say Im adequate
I think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit
19 years I been pimpin since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then
Seamless transition Im the new fresh prince gettin pennies for my thoughts
So I put my 2 cents in
Top of the mornin I am dropin a coin in plus
Im changin the game you see me swapin a joint in
They put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together
For they buy us out
They profit from the event
We handin fliers out
We profit from the attempt to hand desires out
But rich is how were all endin up
So if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up

You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
Its funny how someone elses success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there
But, Im gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
Im gon need you to say something baby
Im gon need you to say something baby
Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since Ive been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way we fell apart, girl, its sad to see
Your life was good, but me and you, we a catastrophe
If I was a success, oh, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic, girl, Im feelin paralyzed
If I could choose, you would always be a friend of me
The more money I made, you actin like my enemy
Its crazy, I cant help it if you feelin change
Thought the pressure would turn you to my diamond babe
How could somethin so familiar be so strange?
Closest friends gettin strange when your status change
Why is it my mistake that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that have my back?
We were the perfect pair, and now it seem that we dont match
Is it the money? Want me to give it back?
This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
Its funny how someone elses success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there
But, Im gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
Im gon need you to say something baby
Im gon need you to say something baby
Uh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Lets toast to the fact that I moved out my mommas basement
To a condo downtown cause its all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50
But now Im at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But Im addicted to this life, its gon be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
Cause whats a star when its most important fan is missing?
This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
Its funny how someone elses success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there
But, Im gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
Im gon need you to say something baby

You say its simple, its who you ought to be
Look in the mirror, you are not what you see
You say its simple, but arent your wings tired?
To tell the truth, why do you have to hide?
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my ladys track and I sprinkled some rap in it
They telling me lies
Whats wrong with being someone else?
No shame, and living life their way, tell me lies
They like, Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We cant fathom how it feel to be forever confined.
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, Im ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that Ive accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
Its like
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I dont really know if I can take it now
Tell Me Lies - Scene 2
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my ladys track and I sprinkled some rap in it
And now they like, Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We cant fathom how it feel to be forever confined.
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, Im ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that Ive accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
Cause the fabrication would help to settle that
And imagination would ease the pain
I came into this world as honest and pure
But cant guarantee to you that Imma leave the same, so
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I dont really know if I can take it now
Tell me anything but the truth
Cant figure out how Im supposed to make it now
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I dont really know if I can take it now
Tell me anything but the truth
Cant figure out how Im supposed to make it now, tell me lies

Look, tell me what you really wanna see
I had the greatest experience shooting that video, What’s it Gonna Be?
I had to say it wowing, my heartbeat started pounding
Walked on the set while she got dressed
In cock rings on her outfit
Janet, why you doing this to me?
At the time I couldn’t believe we both were starring in this movie
Youre in my video, you know a nigga loved it
I spent 2.4 million on the fucking budget
All my jewelry flooded, see how the kid was on?
First rap nigga album you’ve ever featured on
And I was weak in the Lord, despite the things we said
My first words to Hype Williams is “I can’t believe this dream”
Shot a solo scene, I tried to make mines better
But I love when we shot together, and we rubbed up on each other
But I’m a little jealous, Tip, your tongue went in her mouth
In that Poetic Justice movie, from what I can account
You know what we be ‘bout…
Any time, huh?
Any place, baby?
Now, you know, at the time, I was really
I really had my crush on shorty, man, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I was in love with shorty since she was
Penny and all that on Good Times and shit, you know what I mean?
Ayo, Kamaal, you’s a fucked up dude for doing that to me, man
You broke my heart with that, man
Come on, Buss, you know how many dudes say that to me? Like…
Once a day, girl, truly
We grew up with her through the lens of a camera
Didn’t have much, but dare said I’m having her
Shorty was the joint, here’s my case and point
Me and ‘Pac rollin’ L’s in the trailer
Both of us get to scheming how to nail her
First movie about to come out in the theater
Pleasure principle, butt to the makeup truck, so ill I gave her my code
We kissed, I took her control, we swapped as all the film rolled
A marathon, we kept this good thing going, sunset, the moon, it came on
In my mind it would prolong
Listen, the scene was deaded, but I wanted my own edit
Me and Justice kissing keep it going, two pros with credit
A memorable summer in ’92 out in Cali
When I got back up top my niggas asked about the fatty
And did I smash her madly, to that I had to answer
Negative, but I’d give anything to be her dancer
A captivating lady, I used to be her baby
Good Times, they never fading
Look back and celebrate Poetic Justice
At any time, and any place, I don’t care who’s around
At any time, and any place, I don’t care who’s around
In the thunder and rain, you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand moving up my thighs
In the thunder and rain, you stare into my eyes

Hey, how you doin?
Look I just I cant stop thinking about you
I-im sorry I made a mistake
I just want to be with you
I just wanna tell you what I feel
I just need to look into your eyes...
Please...
Can I come over?
Verse 1 :
Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I’ve been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I’ve been drinking so much
That I’ma call her anyway and say
Chorus :
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
Cause I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he’s not around
I’m just sayin’, you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I’m just sayin’ you could do better
And I’ll start hatin’, only if you make me
Verse 2 :
Always by myself now, I never thought Id be without you
But its like all this shit I did was just able to cloud you, yeah
Cloud your mind and every thought you have of me, but I just want you
To be happy so Ill fuck off and let you be
And whats most confusing is you never have the time for me
Then complain I dont do shit when youre the one too blind to see
That I had all hopes in it, you were the one that took them away
But I dont even care no more, I dont even hope or pray so
Ima tell you something, for me its all over
You got me drunk on your lies
But now Im all sober
Ready to move on to another
But Ive still been drinking so much
So Imma call you anyway and say
Chorus :
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he’s not around
I’m just sayin’, you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I’m just sayin’ you could do better
And I’ll start hatin’, only if you make me
Verse 3 :
I think Im addicted to all this shit
And everything you put me through
You know Id cross the world on foot just for the chance to be with you
But now you pushin limits
Showin up with other guys
A smile to hide the sadness but its only a disguise
Cause all these other men have nothing on what I have to offer
Im burnin with your love and drowning in your water
Ive said once before but Ill repeat it even more
That theyre just temporary while Im always at your door
I was ready to take you back no matter what you put me through
But now I dont even care no more and the fault belongs to you 
Yeah, and the fault belongs to you 
So what am I supposed to do now
Just forget all of our history
Guess thats the only plan but the reason is a mystery
Im into you
Cause I know it very well
I guess I was something you were weak enough to sell
I was in a cell, hell, still caught up in your spell
Found the way out now, so Ill grab the mic and fucking yell, hell..
Cause you even laughed that time I fell
Now its over, cuz I saw inside your shell
Hello 
Outro :
I’m just sayin’, you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I’m just sayin’ you could do better
And I’ll start hatin’, only if you make me
Phone call :
I cant come over? alright
Guess ima just kick it here then uhm
You should stop by if you feel like it, yeah
I hope one day you will realize I did truly care for you
I promise youre gonna miss me being there, putting up with you, refusing to give up on you, youre gonna regret everything
Youve done to me including all the damage youve caused and someday
Youll turn back and I wont be waiting for you any longer
I might have been worthless to you but

Astro, yeah

To win the retreat, we all in too deep

Hit my eses, I need the bootch 
Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo 
Told her, Hop in, you comin too

Pass this to my daughter, Ima show her what it took 
Baby mama cover Forbes, got these other bitches shook

Look, I know
Girls love Rihanna
Girls love to act like they famous
Girls hate when niggas get smarter
Catching the moves that they thought of
These days its hard to meet women
Feel like they all aint no different
Ive been avoiding commitment
Thats why Im in this position
Im scared to let somebody in on this
No new friend, no no new
You know just how this goes
You got your fair share of admirers
That call your phone
Your ringtones Pour it up
So you be turnt up all night long
But if youre alone then
Pour it up, Pour it up
Watch it all fall down
Girl thats how we ball out
Go on and take a puff
Pour it up, Pour it up
Thats how we ball out
Watch it all fall down
Pour it up, Pour it up
Pour it up, Pour it up
Watch it all fall down
Pour it up, Pour it up
Cause those other boys are practice
And this aint no time for acting
And this aint no time for games
And this aint no time for Instagram
And this aint no time for locking your phone
And hiding your message when you doing wrong
And Im in the zone
This is why Ive been saying
No new friends, no no no
You know just how this go
This is not four years ago
Your girls tell you all the wrong things
And they know that they all wrong
I come up with hits that make
Your home girls wanna call my phone
All my young boys round me screaming
Get rich and buy shoes and clothes
Where we learn these values?
I do not know what to tell you
Im just trying to find a reason
Not to go out every weekend
I need someone that will help me
Think of someone besides myself
I need someone who dont like rappers
No, Cuse I dont wanna fight no more
Plus Im not wild no more
Neither one of us wanna be called a child no more
No im not alone
Even though my heart is tucked
Let me get yo girls alone
So i can make yall

I got my eyes on you
Youre everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion
Endlessly

Check 
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, shes like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, Im type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, its quite low
Alright so
I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin the ice so
What is about to unfold
No tellin like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
Its only if shes nice though
I aint about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Bens rice throw
That is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world
Got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But Id rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I dont really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my 
Let me give you my 
Then call me anytime, Ill bet you Ill be around
 
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like I aint getting service in your area
You be like Nigga get your bars up
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong
I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But Id rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby! 
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I dont really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my 
Let me give you my 

I should be downtown, trippin on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is this that got you all gassed up?
Changin your opinions on me
I was only gone for the last two months
But you dont have the time to wait on me
I tried with you
Theres more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I can do
But that just didnt sit right with you
And now youre tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now youre throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now youre throwing dirt on my name, on purpose
And you dont feel no way, you think I deserve it
Feel a way, feel a way, feel a way
Ive stopped listenin to things you say
Cause you dont mean them anyway
Feel a way, feel a way, feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way
We need to breathe
Theres more to life than hearing stuff and being mean to me
We had to let go of us to show ourselves what we can be
But that just didnt sit well with me
Tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Throwing dirt on my name, in public
You dont feel no way, on purpose
Im messing up all of Drakes words, on purpose.. careful
Careful
Be careful
Be careful
You could never be too careful
Keep ya head away from windows
Keep your arms inside the ride
Trust me with ya body, trust me with ya life
Banging on the windows, baby come inside
Certainly in trouble, maybe you should hide
Imma tell you like
Dont you look up to me, dont trust a word I say
Dont you end up like me, if you learn one thing today
Dont you look up to me, dont trust a word I say
Dont you end up like me, if you learn one thing today
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things this way
Instead of the other way
Instead of the other way
Feel a way, feel a way, young parents feel this way
Maybe we just should have did things this way
Instead of the other way
Instead of the other way

They wishin and wishin and wishin and wishin

Dont call up at 6 AM to talk here with me
You know how I like it when you missin on me
I dont wanna go for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon tell the story, that was different with me

pops champagne

I always wonder why you bother putting makeup on
You dont need it
And even though I always tell you that youre beautiful
Ill repeat it
Cause I dont want no singer, I dont want no model
And I dont want no fashion designer or nothing
I just want your love
I promise you thats more than enough for me
Chorus:
All you gotta do is come real
Shawty what the deal?
Dont think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
I wouldnt have it any other way 
Verse 2: Kyoko
Baby just because I wanna look good
Dont mean that I aint real
Not in the least bit
All the clothes and doing of my hair, face, nails
Make me feel good
And Ill keep it up
Im not sayin what you been stayin to me
Aint exactly
What I need to feel and know
Youre the one Im wearing for
And where Ill always go when I need a real love
Kyoko Chorus:
So stay real
What you make me feel
Is true beauty of the ultimate appeal

Cool N Dre
Uh, pull up on ‘em bitches, get out, walk
Way to many holes, like I play golf
She’s somewhere in Wayne’s world, stranded, lost
Bitch catchin feelin’s like Randy, Moss
Young Money shit, got the bathroom door locked
Tune go hard, y’all softer than my car top
Hank Gathers, I’ma ball til my heart stop
Nice red bone in a thong and a bra top
Lookin for a queen from a king-size bed
I can make that pussy stand up and drop dead
Fuckin’ with Lil Tune then a nigga get murked
A nigga get kilt like a muthafuckin skirt
I do it like Nike, I’m psychic I knew you like it
Run up in ya ass, than I dash like a hyphen
This is priceless, not for sale
And I unveil, Ms. Shanell
The feeling of your arms around me
I swear that I can’t get enough
I’m staying up all night
Wishing you were here with me
And when I’m with my girls
Theyre trippin’ cause it won’t be long
Before you have me rushing home, cause
Boy you’re everything I need
I don’t wanna see you leave
I got time if you got me
Don’t you know you make it feel
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
Soooo gooood
And when youre gone too long
I’m waiting with your T-shirt on
Playing love songs
The closer I get to you 
You make me feel good
You tell me love is crazy 
I guess that we are too 
There aint a thing I won’t do
To prove that I’ll be here for you, oh 
You know I wake up like a king, get up, stunt
Take advantage of the day, this shit wont happen more than once
Know I’m ready for whatever, ready for the action
I’m still focused on my shit, but, girl, I’m up for a distraction
Got a body like a stripper, but tell me she a student
But some strippers are students, so I tell her ass to prove it
You know, yeah show me all your books and some ID or somethin
I just wanna know that you can teach me somethin
Boy you’re everything I need
I don’t wanna see you leave
I got time if you got me
Don’t you know you make it feel
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
Soooo gooood
Baby our song is on the radio
Our song is on the radio 
Our song is on the radio 
Turn it up on your stereo 
Cause Im dedicating this to you 
Baby our song is on the radio

Don’t you know you make it feel 
So good, good, good

So good, good, good 
Soooo gooood, yeah 

Ive been out walking
I dont do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
These days
I stopped my rambling
Never been once a gambler, my town
But for you, for you, for you, just once
It might be fine these days
These days
Ive met some women
I wish I had resisted these days
These days
These days I seem to think about how I have failed to change all of my ways, ohh
These days
Yeah, I had a lover
Dont think Id risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
Just listen to the life Ive made in songs
These days
Ive had lovers
Ive had lovers, one after another
But this time, me, myself and I are just fine
These days
These days
Ive stopped the dreaming
I dont do too much scheming these days
These days
I sit inside a chauffeur car
With windows down and count the stars these days

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

And Ima leave on one more note
One more motherfuckin note
Its like this, look at him
I aint been here in a minute
Cut the lights off
I feel fantastic right now, baby
I said I used to keep the porch lights on
And now I keep the Porsches lights on
Just to let them know their foresights wrong
Where this rapper goin with that obscure ice on?
He a lame, Im just tryna get my mature life on
OD, OD, everybody know me
Even fans that resemble them kids in the O.C.
Oh me, oh my, them girls love me like Seth Cohen
So get a grip, get a glass, pour the X.O. in
I dare one of these niggas to say Im not insane
Pick a road cause where you drivin is not a lane
And rest in peace to Pimp C, life is not a game
Takin over the world, no Pinky, just a lotta brain
He bout to send them the shit that Im on
You probly could have predicted Im on
My sense of judgments officially gone
Up into the air all the smoke from the Swisher is blown
Im grown, Im grown
Im livin in this elevator zone alone
Im up so high Im never comin down
And you say you got them hoes, but they never comin round
I got Penthouse walls, I stay high above your ass
And I can see it all, my balcony is glass
And wifeys over , but moneys over 
Cause moneys under , my life is such a 
Thats not the way it has to go, thats just what I prefer
And do not disagree with me, its best you just concur
Im a legend with a legacy that cant help but survive
Even when I fuckin die they gonna bury me alive
And Im so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
Im livin good, grippin wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight, no creases, p-p-peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air, we good 
Bitches over there, we good 
Money on the floor, we good
OD, OD, everybody know me
Oh no, Travie high on life again
Feel like I swallowed a whole bottle of Vicodin
So high I wanna cry like tiny violins
In my best mode, Depeche Mode, enjoy the silence
Stop the violence — how, when every line
Is like the motherfuckin Watts riots pourin out of my pen?
Aight then, be easy, Ima get back
Gentleman with a superlative use of syntax
And I done gave up the narcotics
But I cant leave the crib without some xanax in my wallet
Hello, my name is Travie, and Im a life-aholic
Told em all these beats is like the Wallace to my Gromit
The Alfred to my Bruce Wayne, stripes on my candy cane
One without the other, Soul 4 Real without the Candy Rain
Super trooper like a gun-totin handyman
Ask me how Im livin, bet I tell ya fine and dandy, man
Check his vital signs, they peakin off the meter, man
Ima live forever in Neverland with Peter Pan
Fuck pullin the 9 out, Ill pull a Amy Winehouse
Sippin Purple Rain with Mary Jane girls in my house
Isaiah, Ima see ya when I get there
Until then hold me down like gravity, its Travie 
And Im so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
Im livin good, grippin wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight, no creases, p-p-peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air, we good 
Bitches over there, we good 
Money on the floor, we good
OD, OD, everybody know me
Ha! I’m bout to overdose on life
Somebody please pass the needle
So if I comatose tonight you wont have to ask the people
If the things that I seen through my Prada frames got me paid
Watch me, mane, Im a cocky slave with this Rocky chain
I got I got my veins cluttered with this bud
And this name of it is Fame and its all up in my blood
Tryna suppress the too fresh feeling I got, ooh yes
Im in it for the hugest duplex, livin like Im Hugh Hef
Every other night I need a brunette for group sex
Leave em with a bruised neck, then I yell: Whos next?
Stand em in a line
This is New Factz City, take this crack between your thighs
Im promethazine, fuck the Queen
Sniff the white horse of success and then let him lean
 Tryna match my high on life
 Gotta catch the spot on my flight
First-class, known of the aroma of the smoker life
Got me like a stoner, a zoner, but nah, its never over
 I stick my tongue out
Sippin Remy conceited, Im teasin every bum out
Hung out with celebrities from every drug house
So when you remember me say that I was strung out
 Im a addict for the green cash
Ima OD, so fluck goin to rehab
And Im so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
Im livin good, grippin wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight, no creases, p-p-peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air, we good 
Bitches over there, we good 
Money on the floor, we good

Uh, uh
Its 10 oclock on a Wednesday and I know youre home
Drivin up and down your street
Hopin that youll come outside
Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me
Childish as it seems, itll make it all better, better
Selfish as it is, this just aint about you no
Did me wrong every time we were together, -gether
And thats why
Im gonna stunt on you
Im gonna stunt on you
You let me go, little did you know

Check, 1-2, 1-2, bitch
You expensive, you know that?
Im high maintenance a little bit but not in a
Not in a negative way
I just like extremely expensive things
Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games cause they feel like they know me 
You dont know me, nigga, I done changed 
So dont be trying to be putting on shit off in the game 
This aint no motherfucking 91
We out here rapping for money you niggas rapping for fun
I dont fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
You would think its all mine the way I took it
You would think it broke down the way I push it
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldnt?
Working, working, working, working, aint ya?
You dont have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I wont have affairs, Im yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
You hit me like “I know you’re there with someone else
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio so get undressed
Lets do the things that we say on text
I want to get straight to the climax 
Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back
Cause you talk like you got what I need
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze
Talk like you bet it all on me
And you can’t take no L’s off me
I know you been...
Working, working, working, working, aint ya?
You dont have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I wont have affairs, Im yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
How far we go
Always seems to get better with time
Wont you, outsmart me
Told me that your brain works better than mine
Tell me I should know you
I got to know you again
You want me to show you
Im gonna show you again
Now were in the zone
Gon let me all in again
And now youre coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Now youre coming over
Over and over again
Over and over again
You tell me I should know you
But Ill get to know you again
And you want me to show you
Im gonna show you again
When were in the zone you
Gon let me own it again
And now youre coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Now youre coming over
Youre coming over
I wet all the floors of your ego
Feel like I was slipping away
And you know that I aint gonna go, aint gonna go nowhere, nowhere
Cause some of these things never change, no, no
I know that you know, that you know, you know thats its true
Theres a lot on my mind and you bother the times that I matter with you
But we keep it way more way more than, way more than 100, we keep it 110
Show me what I gotta do
I know you been working, working, working, working, aint ya?
You dont have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I wont have affairs, Im yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
And before you leave here 
And until you do babe 
Aint about me no more 
Tonight Ill make sure 
And before you leave here 
But before you do 
It aint about me no more 
Make that sure you 
Part 2: Make Sure
Get you on top of me
We can do this still properly
Get your hands in the air, do your hair back
Youre like a winning ticket off the lottery
But you dont, yeah, you dont want to start on me
Yeah, you dont want to start with me
But you should, keep shaking that in front of me
Unless youre down to do this publicly
You know, you know you gon get comfortable
On the rug with me
And I fuck with you
So if you really fuck with me
Get as freaky as you wanna be, girl its up to you
And she hit me with that I dont do this normally, but for you Ill make exceptions
Lets see whats next then
And it makes so much sense now 
Girl it makes so much sense now 
You know that Im gon make sure now 
Make sure, make sure 
Make sure, make sure 
Make sure, make sure 
You know I gotta make sure, gotta make sure 

I was like, You won. Why are you posting your text message? Just chill. Take your W, and if you feel you didnt deserve it, go get better — make better music. It felt cheap. It didnt feel genuine. Why do that? Why feel guilt? You think those guys would pay homage to you if they won?
This is how the world works: He made a brand of music that appealed to more people than me, Hov, Kanye and Kendrick. Whether people wanna say its racial, or whether its just the fact that he tapped into something we cant tap into. Thats just how the cards fall. Own your shit

I cant feel my face when Im with you
So just dance dance dance dance

Just dance dance dance dance

Yeah, Ho!
Its Drake, uh, uh, Ho!
Do that dance, do that dance
You special girl, dont leave me baby
To find another just like you wont be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that youll come back
Look I ought to be thankful with women I have plenty of luck
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
Or maybe before, Im here waiting to score
Its long gone like brothers having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because its safe to explore
Forget, wait till its right, now its wait till its more
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them Im not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change
You special girl, dont leave me baby
To find another just like you wont be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that youll come back
You special girl, dont leave me baby
To find another just like you wont be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that youll come back
I dont get it, its like my fairy was sick
Its like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
Its something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
Im guessing maybe Shemar Moore isnt really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and its like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something its like and cant be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I cant settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me Imma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me Imma have three kids
I dont want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, Imma change, yeah this Summer is grown
Im running along, before I raise one of my own
You special girl, dont leave me baby 
To find another just like you wont be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at 
Baby just promise me if you go that youll come back
You special girl, dont leave me baby
To find another just like you wont be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at 
Baby just promise me if you go that youll come back 
Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Easy baby 
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Easy baby
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah because you special baby
Yeah this the remix right here
Yeah, trendsetters

I aint felt the pressure in a little while
Its gonna take some getting used to
Floatin all through the city with the windows down
Puttin on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
Its gon take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They dont love you like they used to man
Man that shit you talking raising my sodium
When I step to the podium
Like they bringing the trophy in
They like Aww, there he go again
I do what I got to do to ride up in that European
I knew back when I was playing Little League down at Bobian
That, that boy had that glow like he ran off with plutonium
Back when I had a crush on every girl on Nickelodeon
Man I knew I had to be in and out of Fallopian
Bank accounts at Wachovia
I cant be no custodian
Just imagine how the drama felt
Imagine how my momma felt
Swimming in the debt boy I was hungrier than ever
Ya this must be how piranhas felt
I had to put my G-Shock back on just to go remind myself
When we needed all kind of help
Back when we was all alone on our own
Now they on my phone brrrr Sean Don Corleone
Fuck every OG who passed up on my and put me on a song
Except for Ye so Im forever repping foot up on the throne
You was popping back when I was wearing pow chains
Now you back at home, how mane?
Whole squad come together killing shit like the Power Rangers
I stay in tune and out of danger
Lady on the way Mercedes on the way
Album on the way
Rapping like I got a baby on the way
Im like Baby with the pay
Pay me when? Today
Bitch it’s do or die, seven days a week and holidays
Ho ass bitch
I aint felt the pressure in a little while
Its gonna take some getting used to
Floatin all through the city with the windows down
Puttin on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
Its gon take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now

Been cookin with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot 
Put it in the freezer just to chill quick
Oven 0 to 100, yo, real quick
What you cooking with? These is real mitts
Knowin all the chefs gon feel this
Im the real Chef Curry with the pot, boy
Stove is gettin hot, boy
Olive oil by the box, boy

Lighter flick
Feel like Tune
Im iller than the illness that these people wish me
Drake be Joshin around but life wasnt Nickelodeon or Disney, is you kidding me?
My resume is thicker than Nicki, Im busy-busy
I remember doing halftime at Jackson, Mississippi
Wasnt drivin Cadillac then, but shit still found a way to escalate quickly
Wanted people to miss me, changed shit after Nipsey
Took the fun away, now the funs done
Roses right now though, tell em to run some
You dont have to see the score to know that I won some
True colors always come out like the sun does
Specially when you assumin the role of that nigga
I keep my circle small so the blunt gets back quicker
I just woke up and tripped on a glass slipper
I guess Cinderella mustve called up her own Uber
Ive always been able to see the depths of my own future
Psychic readings, corporate meetings, power lunches
Private funding, hundred push-ups, hundred crunches
Final touches, lemon squeezes, island breezes
Press releases, moving speeches, multi-tasking
Torches passing, strong attractions, forceful actions
Whats really cracking?
I guess Im maintaining, thanks for asking, yeah
And I dont even need to ask how you doing without me
Your captions are more about me than you were about me
Your friends come around, I dont know what they doing around me
They still come around, yeah
Uh, its worth more when you earn it, guilty the verdict
Burnin large bills in the furnace, trash bags and detergent
I touched a little bit of this paper, Im still yearnin
Drove the work three hundred times at least, Im still nervous
Here to speak for the hopefuls, keepin it soulful
Phone face down at the bar, havin drinks at Kimodo
Hope these meetings on roof tops never turn into jail visits
It only put a smile on my face when the scale tippin
Despite the well wishes from yall, I held distance
They prayin my success stories turn into failed missions
They tying me to greats, every other week, Im buying me a safe
I learned its more satisfying when you wait
Had to hide so many stacks in my crib, I got it booby trapped
My closest look like a Off-White vs. Louis match
All that jealousy obvious, I got hipped to it
Even your compliments starting to sound like bitterness
All the pressure Im living with
Every line delivered with hunger, my flow a sure thing like a death certificate
Soldiers is dead, spilled blood over this bread
Had my family thinking Im in over my head
Bagging up breathing chemicals, when a ki was the pinnacle
Now at my high schools giving speeches, speaking political
Got here being original
Every day its like the new me, the business man, vs. me as the criminal
Im the quiet one in the room, keeping it minimal
Till the house big enough I can park the V in the living room

You know alot of girls be 
Thinkin my songs are about them
This is not to get confused, this ones for you
 
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything other hoes aint never on it
I want this forever I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up
She made me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fuckin best, you the fuckin best
You the fuckin best, you the fuckin best 
You the best I ever, best I ever had
(Aiyyo you make me feel like I need to sit down my woman
And just talk straight to her nigga!!!)

And when I see you, I always wanna mouth to mouth you
Lets go, to the altar so I could officially spouse you

I love your lovin even when your seasonin my food
When shit get ugly, you never let it change the mood
Your always holdin me doooooooooowwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!
You know I love you as my lady
Make me wanna fertilize you have a little Busta baby
And have a couple more and let them drive us fuckin crazy
And have fun while we chasin them around
For as long as I am breathin
Im a rep for you on everything I love and I believe in
And when these other niggas see you they be always schemin
They aint knowin I am wearin the crown
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it

You the best I ever, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say you the fuckin best
Sex, Love, Pain baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I coul prolly sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitchesll buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl, the money aint the iss-ue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee, cause I be so official
My shirt aint got no stripes, but I can make ya pussy whiiiiiiiiiis-tle
Like the Andy Griffith them song
...And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin for a fix then you should really get ya fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin bra strap pop
All up in ya slot till the nigga hit the jackpot
Im sayin...
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything other hoes aint never on it
I want this forever I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up

She made me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

:
Uh! Ah yeah! See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody

This here is on some truthful shit
Its seems like everything I do your use to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who youve been with!
Thats when I gotta hide what Im feeling inside
So you still think Im confident and damned
Is this gonna last?
Youre up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feels Like Im in crazy competition with the past
Thats why I gotta ask, is anything Im doing brand new
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything Im doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
This here is something personal
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
So I dont ever question you and damn
I cant even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself, but Im a couple steps behind
Thats why I gotta ask, is anything Im doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything Im doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new girl
This here on some remix shit
Seems like ever thing I do they leakin it
And I hate hearing stories of who im sleeping with
I swear I got to hide what I got in my ride
So she still think im confident and damn
How long will this last
My life is on the pedestal, am I moving to fast?
Feel like im in crazy competition with my past
Thats why I gotta ask
Is anything im doing brand new
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything Im doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Remix baby if he can do good then I can do better
Dont blame me if any man would if he knew betterand dont wont to here about him anymore
But I know you heared this song before..
Is anything Im doing brand new
Is everything Im doing too late
Did he take off your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just like this
Did you spend the night in his bed
On the very first date
Tell me baby am I too late?
Is anything im doing brand new?
Brand new brand new
Show me if this is brand new, new
Ooh ohh yeah yeah yeah

Loves lost, loves gone
Love lost, love is gone
Loves lost, loves gone
Love lost, love is gone
Look
In this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
Rappers they tend to be smilin
Because they swimmin in women
Most of em seeking favors
They come in secret flavors
Thats why I envy Omar
Because so far Im nowhere close to Malik and Deja
And thats some higher learning
Trying to excel with the brake on
Ill have you stuck in the same spot with the tires burnin
And Im a liar turnin 19, jaded with no faith
In any female thats askin what I was earnin
I met this recent lady
She knew a piece of Sadie by Spinners
I guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
Well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
Cause she aint give me the butterflies that Aleshia gave me
Its like Im using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
Now Im out of both and Ive been thinkin of Alisha lately
Im all alone, I got a feelin its on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin is gone and uh
Loves lost, loves gone
Love lost, love is gone
Some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces, circling workplaces
And following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
They get to first bases
Then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin
He wanna know what the first trace is
Now you like MacGyver, cause you sneakin around
And she dont know that you there when you standin right beside her
I can relate to that
I had to take it back a couple of years
When some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact
I bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with
And in the end I listen but I dont see me as they do
Cause its my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
And I used to be eager to buy em the world
Maybe Im confused about what I desire from girls
Either way Im all alone, got a feelin its on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh
Loves lost, loves gone
Love lost, love is gone
Check
And nowadays, some girls are the type of person that
Will tell they friends that they use him which is confusing
Since I aint made them a purchase yet
But theres logic behind it
Emotions double and they try to cover up
Like a mansion with the projects behind it
I tend to freak with this
I get a girl and pretend that I love the spending
And all she gave was a decent kiss
Thinking she been spoiled
But golddiggin is nothing when you can shovel for days
And come up with tin foil
We could dissect it, see
You take a Dominique or another freak in the sheets
And you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
Gave her nothing, ger reputations in jeopardy
Cause it aint take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me
Collectively I look for a proper chick thatll rep for me
Instead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me
For thinking that exists, I got a feeling Im wrong
Nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh
Loves lost, loves gone

Uh, What up yall? Yeah
Soundtrakk, whats popping baby?
If yall aint know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here, I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what Im saying? Legally and illegally, haha
You know what Im talking about?
So, check it out, uh
First got it when he was six, didnt know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week, he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didnt quit, it was something in the air
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldnt fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldnt doubt it, couldnt understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, uh
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldnt stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldnt stop til after dark
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So lets kick
And push
And coast
Uh, uh, uh
What up, Lupe?
Chi-Town, check
My style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barely remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay, but check
It gets boring growing up in Memphis
Tryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably wouldve done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
Luckily, my aunt workin as a nurse
So every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
And plus, shed always give me speeches on the first
If Im stayin in her house, then I need to get some work
I tell her I was there on vacation
She said, You need to be doing something other than skatin
Why dont you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?
Imma let him know that you comin, honey, hes waitin
So now, its me in old school checkered plaid
Playing chess, looking through some old school record ads
He knew I didnt really wanna post here
Opened up the window and told me that the coast clear
And now I coast clear, take a deep breath
Feeling like the Popes here, homie, this is recess
This is each test lifes ever given me
A-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes, Im literally Larnell Lewis with a
Kick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
The kids sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair
Just so the space aint restricted in here, breathe again
Think its obvious that they need my soul
My cousins after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
I said, Auntie, this is a safe career
She said, Drake, I told you there was no skatin here
So I kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push Coast
Fast as the wheels replaced
I gotta find another hobby just to fill the space
So I kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Coast
Peep the way I roll
Just a rebel, lookin for a place to go
So I kick Then push
And coast
Yeah, yeah
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasnt no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push til they couldnt skate no more
Office building lobbies wasnt safe no more
And it wasnt like they wasnt getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
Theyd head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said Theres no skating here
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So lets kick, uh, uh
And push, yeah, yeah
And coast

Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like Im Luminati

Pearl-white candy paint job fly
Big Tymer on the loose
Got a bitch riding 5
And every time I pull up, you know Im iced up
When I step up in the club I light the bitch up
Back on my saddle throwing purple out the truck
Candy paint, rally stripe, shining like us
Pearly white Maybach hatchback
Automatic straps, stash spots under the rack
Bitch, ready to spray that
Foreign grinds, hard times
Getting mines, you know: Uptown
Big time doing time

Youre now fucking with the most requested
The young nigga that everybody is so obsessed with
And black-on-black 62 float majestic
Me and Stunna in it, boy: Im just so connected
Caught up in a popularity contest
Im about to reach my dreams and I aint even got my arms stretched
Thank Me Later: first week, Im taking all bets
Because a million copies isnt really far-fetched
I keep credit cards in cash knots
I keep my darkest shades on til the flash stops
Its for my LA girls getting them implants
And all my DC girls getting them ass shots
Got em for a reason shorty, go ahead, bust it open
I keep a secret, baby: nothings heard when nothings spoken
Haters talk it like my buzz isnt enough promotion
And I just lost a Gucci sandal in the fucking ocean
Damn, I guess the problems of a teen star

And dog thats funny, pay me what you owe me nigga
All cash money

She said: daddy I like sushi, so give it to me raw!
I pulled out my strap condom, looked down there and said naw
Cigar full of Kush you need prescriptions to access
Laying on the mattress with your favorite actress
My blunt was going out, I said, Baby, pass the matches
And let her top me off while Im tapping off the ashes
Classic, but classless
You gassed up, but gasless
Unleaded, yeah, Bun said it, nigga get past it
Taking what you got, you shouldve passed it
You was moving slower than molasses
This time you were nasty
Give it up to him; its a jack
Dont move! This is murder music, nigga
Dont disturb this room. 2 trill Ent Cash Money and Octobers Own

Uh, yea, get in my Slick Rick mode
Na mean?, Im a tell ya a Story real quick
Look, she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
Crib was 2 mil, plus I just bought a couch for ten grand
Even if the house was ten grand
And there was no pool
Would I still be without my swim fan?
The ceiling could be higher
She making requests
Dont know if she feeling me or she be feelin what I buy her
And purses are light now
She use em all the time
So she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
And she simply a new model
Stay spendin dollars
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
At times she a solid chick
And Im a sucka for the cuties
So she always lookin good when my wallets thick
Chillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
Got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
Want the diamonds on the face in the center
Nice guys finish last so Im winnin every race that I enter and she a
Video girl
Eh, yo you have to listen
Im in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldnt call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I cant stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself
My old girl would say
Look at Vida Guerrera
Theres no need to compare her
I bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
I bet shes out meetin directors instead
And frustrated cause shes already been undressed in they head
Be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
Apply for a business loan and Ill bet you that theyll sign
If you a real dime
Poppin as if its your only option
Girl theres things to do
Other than jail time
Look this aint a song dissing half of these rappers
Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
I just give my opinion for laughter
Or maybe to think on
So next time you out at the club
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
You just take in fact he got a stack with a mink on
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
And as ya man I wont back down first
But they got you doing soft-core background work
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over
And he ask questions later and pat down first
But you aint thandie newton, and this aint crash here
The resolutions passed baby, this aint last year
Look, I got a message, Ill say it, I got some beats still
Regina Hall and Garcelle and Elise Neal
Young girls these here women with big dreams
Role models that you can watch on the big screen
If you refuse to change and you that chick still
Respect yourself, dont be convinced that these tricks will
You got an audience believe it or not
My cousin who cant speak know the lyrics to tip drill
Video girl
Eh, yo you have to listen
Im in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldnt call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I cant stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

When I get older
I will be stronger
Theyll call me freedom
Just like a waving flag
Born from a throne, older than Rome
But violent prone, poor people zone
But its my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, but now its gone
Out of the darkness, in came the carnage
Threatening my very survival
Fractured my streets and broke all my dreams
Now feels like defeat to wretched retreat
So we struggling
Fighting to eat
And we wondering
If well be free
We can not wait for some faithful day
It’s too far away so right now I’ll say
When I get older, I will be stronger
Theyll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back
So many wars, settling scores
All that weve been through and now there is more
I hear them say love is the way
Love is the answer thats what they say
But were not just dreamers of broken down grievers
A hand will reach us and will not forsake us
This cant control us, no it can’t hold us down
We gon pick it up even though we still struggling
Au nom de la survie
And we wondering
Battant pour nos vie
We patiently wait for some other day
Thats too far away so right now I say
When I get older, I will be stronger
Theyll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back
When I get older, I will be stronger
Theyll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back
How come when the media stops covering
And there’s a little help from the government
We forget about the people still struggling
And assume that its really all love again, nah
See we don’t have to wait for things to break apart
If you werent involved before, it’s never too late to start
You probably think that it’s too far to even have to care
Well, take a look at where you live, what if it happened there?
You have to know the urge to make a change lies within
And we can be the reason that they see their flag rise again
When I get older, I will be stronger
Theyll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back
And then it goes back
Then it goes back
When I get older, I will be stronger
Theyll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back
When I get older, when I get older

Im a diva, best believe her, you see how she gettin paid?
She aint callin him to greet her, dont need him, her beds made
This is a stick-up, stick-up

Im a, Im a a diva, Im a, Im a a diva 
I be gettin to the money, everybody mad

Everybody hated on him, then he bounced right back
I be gettin to the money, everybody mad
I think Im gettin too much money, everybody mad
The same old nigga from the block
The same old nigga with the pot
The same old nigga from the trap
Everybody hated on him, then he bounced right back

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
Im satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and Im gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Dos what you do, I do what I do
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin
A lot of dudes in my city, they aint saying nothin
A lot of records from here, they get no play
And these labels dont give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay
So these nosy niggas dont know that I get checks all day
Whats he worth? Fans keep trying to guess it
My record aint even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if its beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit
Both of the deals, nothin under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, Ima teach you beginners
Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features, yall better get me while its cheaper than dinner
Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
Im satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and Im gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Dos what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
Im satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and Im gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Dos what you do, I do what I do
Check, the verses Im writin, you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You cant see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
Shell forget you and Ill be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along, your visions just been distorted
Im so throwed, wilin in this, you ask me what the business is
And Ill write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations Ima exceed it
Like a single with only backgrounds
Yall record and when its done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here Ima star with the timin
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin
This for anybody thats searchin for cash
And purchasin fast, you only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like Im listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin, boy
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
Im satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and Im gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Dos what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
Im satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and Im gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Dos what you do, I do what I do
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is somethin that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
Im satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and Im gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do

Side pieces

Im just trying to get her in the mood
And have her doing all the things shed only do when she get married
So lets do this shit
Tell the reverend all were missing is his blessing
Because before she pop the pussy she need me to pop the question
So we exchange vows
They clap, we take a bow
And shell be doing tricks for daddy

I’m so fuckin dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs
There’s a diamond on my dick so there’s a diamond on her tongue
I can’t feel you baby cause Im romantically numb
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come
There’s nothing under Gods sun that I haven’t done
I got a lot of problems, getting pussy just isn’t one
Girls are like buses every 15 min they run
Now they like potato chips I just can’t have one

Yeah, normally it aint a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late and used to blame me
She said Im too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldnt change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie
We aint even tryna settle, so why try
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi

Even though I hate this distance, it keeps me persistent
One day Ill have your ass up in this kitchen

The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when theyre in them shoes

And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC Serch til I reach third base
And when I get home Ima hit home plate

Ye, the picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
In Playboy mags like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian, be a lady at it
You know whats a crazy thing
Some girlsll make you wait longer than A.C. Green
Passion of the Christ, thirty-three year old virgin

Man, hate is so passe, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day
Nigga and it’s just me and my money
Ya don’t even get to play when ya’ll leading by 20
Yeah I infiltrated the game
I was hesitant at first and fear what it would change
Now I’m high off the success and faded off of the fame
And still managed to keep all of my opinions the same
I am so far gone bitch Im outta here
Hotter than standing inside rocking outerwear
I want it all man, I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires

And I love this life, and I won’t trade it for the world
And these niggas fake, that’s why you got to fuck their girls
Get high as kites, and we taking shot’s of syrup

These niggas theyll leave you for dead while you breathin
I feel like she love me, unconditionally, know I can see it

Wild things youre doing at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doing it all just to feel things
Drinkings enough of a vice
Drugs just arent suiting you right

You called me weak and you testing my manhood as we yell at each other
You wanted me to go and put my hands on you just to show you I love you
Just know I can jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you said, despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You acting out, you know you love to see a young nigga suffer
You, you, you know, know, know
Thats not the way to get over me
Thats not the way to get over

I dont know what youre saying

Out on the grind
Rain or shine
Nickels and dimes
Im out tryna to get his paper
I wake up, got money on mind
And I cant get off so I got to get on my grind
Got to get all my ducks in line
My bills in order crackers taking orders
For niggas in the race I got water
For niggas with hate I got llamas
Tissues for they mama
Im flyer than Aladdin on a carpet
Saw A Whole New World when I made my profits
And my jasmine is a rapping
I do it the best, These niggas aint smashing
Raw dog action
I impregenate the beat everytime I speak
A seed of my speech concives and MC! 
Similar to me,so we aint got to write just think
Keep it in the head like T
Spit listerine on the beat
Flossin diamonds and me
Now peep the way I deliver on the beat

She want to be the chick from the other guy
Wanna be a lover I chuckle I laugh

Im out tryna to get his paper
Thats why I roll up and tend to get high
Cause my arms wont extend to the sky
Peer pressure always make me feel lesser than a 10 in they eyes
So I can only grab my pen and advise
Street legends and chicks seem to wonder
Exactly who I am
You know me if you had a job at 16 and under yup
Its Drake and Saint Nick
Take a whiff of this and faint quick
Off a sample of the flow patient
But I dont lie to rhymers
I strip walls and apply the primer
If theres a wall Im gon try to climb-aaa
Without a graded rope
Our navy seal Buddies yelling slurs at me
Im always gon find another way to go
Im minty fresh with the Green like Im made a bathing scope
No bathing ape but Im clean Like Im made of soap
Begging for the fire
Buglars in hear we
We all good in the fam we like Meagan and limiya
I dress like Lou, I sell verses to label
And they give me the next joint
To sound less like you
Thats something I had to say before
Im real picky with real with lyrics
So dont use joints you probably would pay me for
I aint a heat busser
What up to Denik Rusha and Bei Major, Trey Songz, the streets Usher
Leak tracks and heat wax and he bust ya
And then sign ya
This is a reminder
This along the lines of Thrill is Gone still the song
Imma mention Jay even though I feel its wrong
We gave good ambition homegirl couldnt listen
Now she want the Snackpack back and her puddings missin
Bring the topic back
Please dont stop the track
Tropicana never got the hammer by my jock in-fact, I keep my money there
Mixtapes where I top em at
DJ Smallz.com you can shop at that
Speak of shopping Im tryna get a label deal
Tryna live my dreams while awake, tryna make the fables real
No stealing cable trying to have my cable still
Better yet stolen, my grammar is golden
My grammer go harder than most rappers
Theres a certain female rapper I will expose and
For once I think you should tell yo mouth to get to closing
No I didnt pen that Freestyle shit
I got a session with Digs so the beef Im gone end that
Anybody else get the piece that I bend back

Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what Im about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling its wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
Its ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
Its a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected
People just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that youre expecting for someone without the ethics
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
They just wanna say that you aint around
I mean theres always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
That you couldnt help and maybe next time you aint in town
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try
And the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin is fresher
Than most of these rappers running the game
Certain people will copy whats in the past to turn the profit with cash
Theres time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a Range
Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
And watched the game from the bleachers
Because Im really tend to need what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother dont compensate for the other time
I wasted out late at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner Im working hard on the winter
So this album is a labor of love
You say as long as Im staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
That she can rest without a toss and a turn
Because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV
Thats exactly why I often get burned
But Im gonna try to..
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz

I do this for yall man
Malice, Nickelus F, its the REMIX!
Lights slow motion, steppin out the Phantom
All eyes on me, peekin and glancin
Leanin on the wall, with b-boys dancin
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin like the kings ransom
One chick, each arm, makin it a tandem
Flat here costing like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin, cars wit options
We livin like kings, homie, you just watchin
And Im a show for ya, marble flo for ya
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler
I aint bluffin, cop jewels off the Russian
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like hes blushin
Miami breezes, we cross seasons
Escaped indictments, thank you Jesus
Yall haters aint even got a clue
While we get this paper, and thats how we do
R-E U-P G-A-N-G
R-E U-P G-A-N-G
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
Im satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and Im gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Dos what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
Im satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and Im gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Dos what you do, I do what I do
Check, the verses Im writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You cant see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, shell forget you
And Ill be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just noticed me now but I was here all along
Your visions just been distorted
Im so throwed I live this, you ask me what the business
And I write a sixteen and report it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations Imma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds yall record it
When its done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here Imma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody thats searchin for cash, and purchasing fast
You only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like Im listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy!
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
Im satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and Im gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Dos what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
Im satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and Im gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Dos what you do, I do what I do
Ugh, do what you do and I does what I does
These chicks love me, they say boy, you’re clean-cut for a thug
You should see the stampede when we rush in the club
It’s like a offensive foul how they running to us
Charge all their drinks on that platinum card
Lord I got ‘em hooked like the back of a bra
Ugh man, I am, like Sam, I am
I get the green, plus the eggs and ham
And a pen for any beef trying to approach us
Let the sucker burn, I don’t even flip em over
Nickelus F. teamed with Drake, now you mad as hell
Ain’t seen a better looking union since Gabrielle
Well, Im hot as hell and I don’t even need a stylist
Spit the infernal like the Real World Challenge
V.A., Nickelus F., push your mileage
You’re running up our animals like white boys, they cow-tip
Everybody knows Cap from the south of Wallis
I ain’t gotta use a fist, slap you with the chalice
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
Im satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and Im gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Dos what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
Im satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and Im gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do

Someones gotta take the lead tonight
Whose it gonna be?
Im gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say
You should say it right now
You give me a feeling that Ive never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
Its becoming something thats impossible to ignore
And I cant take it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, Im ready
If you ask me, Im ready
I know you once said to me
This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be
Time is only wasting
So why wait for eventually?
If we gon do somthing bout it
We should do it right now
You give me a feeling that Ive never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Its becoming something thats impossible to ignore
It is what we make it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way Im sayin
If you ask me, Im ready
If you ask me, Im ready
Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away
I cant say I came prepared
Im suspended in the air
Wont you come be in the sky with me?
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way Im sayin
If you ask me, Im ready

Look, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin
Hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
I ask you to have some patience
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Yall part of the speech cause
Im from the city where
People be gettin lazy, litterin in the streets
And the club district is poppin like literally every week
And promotersll push flyers, money exchange hands
Liars sell you they dreams and dummies exchange plans
Hustlers give you events, bouncers give you pass
Directors give em a shot, so girlsll give up the ass
And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
And start rolling together like Snoopy and Woodstock
Daffy and Bugs, its all laughing and hugs
Til the dude catch a plane and she back where she was
Right back on the bus, its a shame cause now
At his window she throwin bricks like Shaq in the clutch
You can see thats shes colder cause he doesnt hold her
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
Know that he tried ta told her that he couldnt mold her
If this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say
If you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin
Hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
I ask you to have some patience
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Yall part of the speech cause
Now up north theres five artists deservin a listen
And Im one of em, the other four you know who you are
But if you gotta think through chances are that it aint you
I single-handedly carry out what you cant do
And see I take a couple of breathers
And then things come together on the spot like a couple thats eager
If you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
Go ahead, I couldnt give two damns like a couple of beavers
But uh, the in & the out and the plans seeming ill
Whenever Im out in Memphis the man seen as trill
And every verse the man seem to kill
You can find him with black jays and socks like Im Andreena mill
Japan and Brazil, the audience screaming
And then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
Advances to deals, financing appeals
The hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh
Look, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin
Hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
I ask you to have some patience
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend

Me and you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you aint use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
Thats a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
Ill wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If its over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that Im on and who is in your past
Im refreshing and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, Imma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of thats ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class Im teaching
Cause guaranteed Imma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And Im the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
Im two floors under but my rooms sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you dont wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before Ill grab that for ya like holding a door
Cause mines it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
Cant let you go
Cant let you go
I cant let you go
You were late to school
Im gonna have to see you after class
Youve been a bad girl
Someones gonna have to teach you a lesson
Youve been a bad girl
Someones gonna have to straighten you right up
Youve been a bad girl
Someones gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someones gonna have to teach you
You can call me professor
But baby, you broke the rules
You wont get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
You work it off 
Baby I can give you extra credit 
But theres something else
Girl, can I frisk you?
Search your body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
Its cause youre hidin WMDs
And Im gonna sentence you
Baby, you can do your time on me
I cant let you go
I cant let you go
You were late to school
Im gonna have to see you after class
Youve been a bad girl
Someones gonna have to teach you a lesson
Youve been a bad girl
Someones gonna have to straighten you right up
Youve been a bad girl
Someones gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someones gonna have to teach you
Just for the moment
For tonight
Can I make you mine?
Is it me, is it mine?

K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac
All that bullshits for the birds, you aint nothing but a vulture 
Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
Youll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah 
Told you that Im leaving, deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah 
I know youre mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now Im finna throw them deuces up
Im on some new shit
Im chucking my deuces up to her 
Im moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
What you mean I aint call you? I hit you when I landed
Im waitin in my hotel room
Seems like were arguin more and its gettin less romantic
Yeah, I think shell be able to tell soon
But Ill fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
Ill fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationships amazin still
I might just put up with the arguin and stay, for real
You lookin bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
Im willin to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that youll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin business
Is mindin your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
Its useless, all this fightin, lets get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin issues, you fuckin bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, Ima be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch 
Im stupid, but I wont get my drama on
What Im dealin with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk bout “you know who”
I dont know who you talkin bout
Im on some new shit
Im chucking my deuces up to her 
Im moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, aint gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it aint yours
I did things for her; aint rich, aint poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just aint know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody thats a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin sad songs
Im on some new shit
Im chucking my deuces up to her 
Im moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye bye

Baby I like your style
Grips on your waist
Unruly me say
This sound just done the place
Streets not safe
Papi never run away
Even when hes away
Oti, oti, theres never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
Thats why I need a one dance
Poppy got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I dont know
Watch the whole dance get turned over
Said I need a one dance
Poppy got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I dont know
Watch the whole dance get turned over
Mixpak sound
Baby I like your style
Ya unruly mudas!
Strength and guidance
Next soundbwoy is not my friend
Metro not smoke, so his yiy change
Unruly gang, worldwide ting
Dont know why they still try me
Bun Vegas, he cyaan reply me
I dont wanna spend time fighting
Unruly time
Thats why I need a one dance
Drizzle got the machine in his hand
What sound can test? I dont know
Watch the whole dance get turned over
Said I need a one dance
Poppy got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I dont know
Watch the whole dance get turned over, say
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
My brudda
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Wicked, wicked, wicked
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Drizzy Drake, Popcaan, mudas
Oh yeah, very long time

What you doin? What you doin to me?
You know that you got me
You got me where you want me
You know what you doin
Nah-nah, I dont want you to stop
Come here
Go!
Never been a people person, always been a peoples person
Know how to get a person, dont know how to keep a person, yeah
But you know everybody need somebody
And everybody aint gon be somebody
I mean, its been like twenty years since my mother has seen somebody
Im convinced that she thinks thats its too late or somethin
I should try and set her up on a date or somethin
You deserve love, how long are you gon wait for somethin?
Nah, we gon find you someone doin some
Someone rich and single, is Lionel Richie single?
Haha, okay, Im jokin, Im kiddin, Im playin
At least tell me that you hear all this shit that Im sayin
I dont wanna be the only man you laugh with
Life is quick, you should start it happy and end it happy
She ask me Are you and... happy?
I never told you what ended up happenin
As I pretend you havent made a mess
Of this young man, its crazy how I degress
And now you got the best of me 
Dont worry bout the rest of me 
And now you got the best of me 
Dont worry bout the rest of me
Oh, the world is far from perfect
Cause I only think of you
But I feel like it is worth it
Everythings movin in slow motion
Movin in slow motion
You smile at me, I act like Im not impressed
You aint too please, in a place that I cant protest
And now you got the best of me 
Dont worry bout the rest of me 
And now you got the best of me 
Dont worry bout the rest of me 
Inside is bliss, but outside my worlds a wreck
Cause every time that you pass me
I cant help but turn my neck
And now you got the best of me 
Dont worry bout the rest of me 
And now you got the best of me 
Dont worry bout the rest of me 
Oh, the world is far from perfect
Cause I only think of you 
But I feel like it is worth it
Everythings movin in slow motion
Its movin in slow motion 
I feel so undeservin of the mere presence of you 
And my vision, it gets blurry 
Everythings movin in slow motion 
Movin in slow motion 
I started believin that crazy shit she told me
Not sure if that makes me crazy or just lonely
Then I got bored, because fightin is boring
And she was gone soon as I started stallin
I dont want it except for when I want it
And even then I beat myself up for it
Thats when you hear me say Im movin on from it
But its obviously something else that I want from it
And then thats how she goes about it
Its hard to act like you want it when you know you got it
Im textin and callin like thats my true callin
And the only time that shes really talking
Is when you she tells me about myself like thats whats important
Startin things over nothin, that shit is overwhelmin
Her main problem is she always think Im up to somethin
And, shit, talking bout it make me wanna fuckin call her
Reverse psychology, whatever you call it
But to answer the question, yeah, I think were happy
Were always reunited, thats a good thing, I guess
Were always startin over, that shit always seems excitin
I dont know, I guess its yet to be seen
Shes busy doin her and Im out here chasin the dream
Honestly, we say a lot of things that we dont mean
Start happy, end happy, with the summer in between, slow motion
Oh, the world is far from perfect
Cause I only think of you 
But I feel like it is worth it
Everything movin in slow motion

Yeah
Right
Ahhhhhh
Aiight
Im bout to do my thing
You ready?
Here I go!
Octobers very own
Drizzy
Taz You aint even got nothin to worry about man
Check
Yeah
Are you listening?
Is anybody listening?
Walk into a room and you can smell the Clive Cristian scent
A lot of niggas is threatened by my positioning
Thrillin bars you think Im writing with John Ghrisam
Pen
I need Rose, nevermind the pricing
Know we brought cake to the party, no icing
No ice on, big Phantom no license
Fuck if youre feelin me as long as your wife is
No one in my city gotta pocket like Drizzy
I can rock fitted Jeans cause my credit card skinny
Its pitch black and covers all incidentials
And Ms. Rhone sorry you aint notice my potential
Fuck ya rappers and your self-proclaimed status
I can only see green now happy St.Pattys
I know you waitin on a last quote
Check the soundscan and you can see that Im the last hope
By the way Im Jewish and turnin 22
Gets depressing when you see your favorite rappers
Goin through it
Tryna re-invent themselves, showin no improvement
Gettin crushed by this light skinned youngn on some
New shit
40 just recorded and who dropped this here
Cos Im tryna fuck Megan Fox this year
And if you got a stylist to cop you gear
And you are in my age bracket, you are not my peer
Fuck you really know about a Eames couch
Frette sheets, perfect touch to a clean house
Wide awake, but a niggas livin ya dreams out
Lookin like a photoshoot everytime the teams out
And is the realest nigga still I
A woman could love me to death but Id still die
So Im about us now
Smith and Wesson flow

And she treating me like I be New Year’s Eve
Counting down the seconds untill she sees me 
One time for the women that want it with Megan Fox
Two times for the ladies that never use Photoshop
Them other girls, they so vanilla
You gotta certain je ne sais quoi
They need to get their French up to par
And, uh, pardon me for asking
Anything I want, I must have it
I make it happen, poof, magic
To bring life, the infatuation
I’m only a figment of your imagination
When I talk, it’s no exaggeration
You won’t find another dude quite like me
 Me and my everything crew
Everything’s big, everything’s new
Drinks on me, so what you wanna do?
Chill right here and head bop to the groove
Yeah, and its VI for life
So if you want, we can fly to the VI tonight
Saint Thomas and Saint Croix, Saint John is nice
So girl, just let me know which one you like
 My plans now to live it up this year
That’s why I shine from my neck to my wristwear
We off, up in the party like we live here
Lights on, everybody’s gone, but we still here, yeah

In the thunder and rain
You stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand
Moving up my thigh
Skirt around my waist
Wall against my face
I can feel your lips
I recognize your fragrance, hold up
You aint never gotta say shit
And I know your taste is
A little bit, mmm high maintenance
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you the flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems and this song’s dedicated to you
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty option plain
Cold nights when you curse this thang
You called up your girl when caught up in the ity bity rain
Heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Don’t approach her with that atari
That a good game always sorry
They say conversation ruination
I can tell
But I can’t right my wrongs
Unless I write em down for real, alright
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
I really know you play this
‘Cus oh boy you test my patience
With all these subjective photographs
And all these one life vacations
Love is not a verb, you should look it in a mirror
Love is not a verb, if you’re lookin for a maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
Fatal attraction is called, what we have in common is pain
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
They say that
Drunk minds, talk sober thoughts, yeah
And is it me that you want, me that you want
I guess it’s me that you want tonight
Cause I think we talk more when your intoxicated, inebriated
And baby I hate it
Cause I think that this the only way you gone open up to me
Gone talk to much to me
Cause this is how this goes I know it
Take one drink to the head and everything just feels right
And if it ain’t right, it’s alright, alright, tonight
I guess amnesia is your thing you do in the morning
Nobodies calling you
You just do that to leave the room, like you always do
I never need you, I just I just wanted you
Wanted, wanted you to love me but trust me
Put thing above me just, put your heart in my hands, yeah
Let me make all the plans, make all the plans, let me make all the plans tonight
Sober thoughts, Sober thoughts, oh yeah oh yeah
Guess it’s me that you want, me that you want, guess it’s me that you want tonight
Can we just be
Open tonight
Cause I know tomorrow we won’t
Hope you remember
Last time September
You said you wouldn’t loose this
Funny right now you won’t quit it, won’t quit
For me and all of them
Yet you wanted me and all of them
You don’t remember that
And I don’t remember you
Drunk minds talk sober thoughts yeah
I guess it’s me that you want, me that you want, guess it’s me that you want tonight
Drunk minds talk sober thoughts awe yeah
Guess it’s me that you want

One, two, three, four
Listen
Seein you got ritualistic
Im cleansin my soul of addiction for now
Cause were fallin apart
A tension
Between us just like picket fences
Well, you got issues that I wont mention for now
Cause were fallin apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin up on my old ways
I cant blame you, no
No
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin up on my old ways
I cant blame you, no
No, no, no
Listen
Harder buildin trust from a distance
Well, I think we should rule out commitment for now
Cause were fallin apart
Leavin
Youre just doing that to get even
Dont pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin apart 
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin up on my old ways
I cant blame you, no
No, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin up on my old ways
I cant blame you, no
No, no, no
No-oh-oh-ah

You act so different around me
I think theres something

Were going to jump right into the battle. All the way from Philadelphia, rapper to my right, introduce yourself
Man, you seen me in the fucking streets. You seen me in the ring. Rone Baby The Prince Soon To Be The King.Lets fucking go baby!Lets fucking go
All the way from Chicago, making his Toronto debut, battler to my left, introduce yourself
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck! Lets go. Yall ready?
Yeah. Rone won the coin toss, Big T lets get it
Big Terrance!
I never seen em say Adam and make the crowd large
See I didnt ask for this
Organik picked, thats a wild card
Just send me a couple thou large and he a dead man, how smart?
You get Terrance and Phillip fo sho in Canada like South Park
Now start
Aint you from Grind Time New York?
Now dont nobody even see you in a battle
I get money in the garden, I dont think Adam even eating in The Apple
Garden, Adam, Eve and Eden and the apple?
Thats the only time yall gonna hear me repeating in this battle
I run up on him with Glock ah...
I cant do that type style
I touch that nigga whipping the ra...
Not in this King Of The Dot crowd
Fuck that
Shalock, boom boom, blocka, blocka, BOW!
I came in this game making Glock sounds and I aint gonna stop now!
Yall got Mr. Chickalaboo back in Canada
Im Mr. Psss Ting/poutine, silencer on it, TING! Dllalat dat doo get
1 in cannon I use routines
That was a reach but Im reaching for two things when Im shooting
Dumping it
Switch it up like a mood ring during a mood swing, you king?
You king?
I heard you was selling coke in college to all with your rich white friends
Shit, I walk up to you like, Hi guys. Giving hi fives, Ill fit right in
Learning all of they connections on how they sneak white in
Then come to/two body they connects like Siamese twins
Friends?
What could this guy do?
This guy is food
All I need is the laces on my shoe
One call, pa-poo
All you hear is ahh ooh
I make a call and Tyrone/tie Rone up like Erykah Badu
You better call Tyrone
Cause the respirator gonna look like you telling the truth on the operator
Flatline
When I stop doing gun sounds?
Unlikely, never
He good...but you better hope the doctors better
Cause Ima give him the toast, they taking Patronshots together
Get at em/Adam for the people I sent at em to get Adam
Im breaking Adam/atom down until Adam is broken down into atoms
Like, where your kids Adam?
Im sick Adam
Ill have my dogs sic Adam
You know why Pat used to bitch Adam?
Cause he started his Facebook page and he didnt add him
Like...forget Adam, dont Facebook, call or Tweet at him
Ill beat the shit out him, Ill point that M at em
Now get madam, I dont if I was Eve
Im stepping back from the plate like they throwing a pitch at em
Point the sig at em, remove his ribs out em
Like God did Adam!
What you want?
Syllable rhymes?
Man the simple its fun
Thats easy like a Christian or nun reading a scripture or songs
Theres two pistols on me, boom, boom, empty the gun
The other one I raise without a care like an illegitimate son
Didnt you say, Black people dont raise they children?
You racist Nazi fag
Guess what, I was raised by my mom and dad
Like, Im cool with black people
Thats until they driving fast get off in traffic and call em a nigga when they driving past
When Daylyt was doing that Pat Stay, whipping the weirdest shit
You and 24/7 was the only people cheering and shit
Shit, cheers and shit
Slapping beers and shit
Like thats the best Daylyt we seen all year and shit
TIME!
So Organik hit my phone up!
About this battle with T
Well he Facebook messaged me and I texted him and he told me to call
You know...international fees
But Organik hit my phone up!
I was taking orders and blazing quarters, he said, How bout T?
I said, Hes outdated as a tape recorder
I said, What about Pat? What about Shots?
I exhausted a lengthy order
Then I said, All right T then I was sounding like Ace Ventura
So I took...T...on
Flipped the switch and then tee...off
Like tee ball or a tee box, you a Scrub go ask T-Boz
Oh thats the T?
The audacity
Brutality
Calamity
Youll get all that from me
Royce? 50? They could go H.A.M. with me
I got a profanity for any pro fan of T
Your girl dont engage in honesty
If she say the only man that she on is T
So you need some friendship, some humanity
But you look like a sea creature, you manatee
They doubted I could pass a T
Like I dont have the capacity
But youll get stretched like a legra tee
And I could do that with alacrity
This shit gon be a travesty
When I kill your ass in front of Travis, T
So bring half of your team or relax against me
And thats a sure fire way to make a casualty
So I heard you almost got signed to Shady Records
Their whole staff been partial
So you flipped out on your Chicago shit
Like, What you gonna do for my brand then Marshall?
So they skipped him cause guys rowdy
Now Im collecting my bounty
Im from Philly but I run this show in Toronto, Im Kyle Lowry
But you second in your city Terry
Thats why they call you Pippen, Terry
And to say you dont get women Terry
That dont take a visionary
I mean, we could find a Mormon tourist in Europe and you still couldnt hit it missionary
No one wants to see your Bear/bare ass
Thats exactly why you single Terry/Singletary
But if beef...what youre facing Terry
Youll get rocked like a mason Terry 
And if they wind up chasing Terry
He gon Jet like he Jason Terry
But I could keep it on Chicago shit
Like where Urlacher played
We could think, Sammy Sosa, a sosa who packed his cane
Or I could him on ice faster than Patrick Kane
Then grab some more rice that are in Patricks chain
You got no H for jabbing veins
You aint slinging crack cocaine
You aint seen a brick or a nic since Patrick played
You aint have Blue Magic since Magic contracted AIDS
You wouldnt draw on me if I was half a page of anime
You wouldnt draw on me if I was a connect the dots handout
You wouldnt draw on me if I was passed out in a frat house
I mean...
You have an imprint in your fat from the weapon on your waist
When you smile, it looks like your lips are being stretched across your face
You fucked up on Total Slaughter because of the glares of everyone there
Let me guess, it wasnt the first time you couldnt take the stares/stairs
And when I heard you got shot...I got jealousssssss
I mean, Im glad youre not out on the streets dead
But if I got popped with a couple shots it would do wonders for my street cred
I mean, who knew the Michelin Man was from Michigan Ave?
Too tired to walk, too fat to sit in the cab
And this is dinner for me
To you dinners a snack
You got me G? Colostomy, I got this shit in the bag
Bro, after these fireworks, hell be calling up life alert
Getting a ride to church, reading his favorite Bible verse
His wife will squirt and then leave him after I make him bite the curb
Hell get a career and have to wear a Hawaiian shirt and tie to work
And the boss at his new office
I bet he, aint gon fuck around
So youll have to change your name from Big T to Big Button Down
And what kind of future is that?
What kind of lose is that?
When youre forever known as The dudes whos fat who used to rap.
Quiet, lets go bitch
(Big T snoring)
I fell asleep in my last round
It felt like I was in the camel clutch
Where Drake at?
Cause Id a ask him, I didnt hear it but, did he land a punch?
My bad, Im just saying that Im being real with him
I dont got that feel with him like Lil Wayne...Baby
If it wasnt for that Cash Money I wouldnt want to deal with him
That long round but Im still winning
I put your face on the ground
I send you to a land of angels, halos and clouds
Oh, everybody in shotgun think its a game
Until now I get mad and intercept a bullet
Thats when the whole game turn around
Welcome me back
But Im at the King Of The Dot pissing on welcoming mats
Aye, whats your obsession with battling black rappers from Smack?
Like its suppose to help you progress up in rap
You say black people dont raise their children.
You saying its a fact
But another fact is that battle with Pat was gay as fuck
And aint no questioning that
I teach you How To Be A Player, where Bill Bellamy at?
Im sexy and fat
Yo, why you and Pat keep texting me that?
Bullets invest in a Mac, fuck loading a clip
Its like I could load a jet ski in that
Wayne Gretsky is back
Slide on this bitch like Im trying strike a match
But she never wipe her snatch
Her puss smell like something crawled up and died in that
Thank God Im back
Battle rap crisis back, beat me?
Its like womens rights activists signing a petition to make Ray Rice come back
Im nice at that
And I pull up to the light it seems
Go head you want to fight but I dont do the Tyson thing
Id rather pull up in a whip, FIRING
All you see is that bitch, pop out a TV like The Ring
Style on em
You see T at Penn State with a fifth of Jaegermeister
Half pint of drank provider
From one of Drakes suppliers
Snoop Dogg vaporizers
Spray this guy and have a K hole tranquilizer
Before they announce that pussy with a W and I aint imitating Plies
You aint as nice as mine
Trying to rhyme in this column and Im like Columbine
A lifes demise
Everybody you like were guys
I still got the steel on the side like Johnny 5
Two nines on me Mike and Live on 99
Dont style in this
Ill beat your Mobb Deep underground, Alchemist
This trigger finger?
It start developing callus
It dont work out/workout, paralysis
If he move its miraculous
Clips? I load a spear in it, Goldberg tackle us
Were savages, blood drinking Draculas
I bet your idea of an Ebola vaccine is
America need to stop letting those damn Africans
You want cold war?
Im a cold war practition- quiet!
That was a cool little round bro
Really Im not that mad at you
...mad at cha
At the beginning of the round you were snoring
Thats called sneep apnea
(Sleep apena
I gotta learn how to talk)
Fuck spitting for a civil war Im dicking up your chicken raw
Im longer than the pinafore and stronger than a Minotaur
What you want friction for?
Im savage as the Chickasaw
He gonna show where them cans is/Kansas?
Its a road trip to Wichita
If you got the heart for this, a double dose of Lipitor
If you on the block then its Madden with the Brickasaw
And I aint talking Ferguson and I aint popping shots
So what you mad at me for dawg? Man Im not the cops
But I can play the judge for this irrelevant geek
Cause if Eric Gardner chokes you wont hear a sentence from me
I mean...
Id love to kill him on a beautiful Sunday like today
Caskets up with the bouquet
Or maybe get him on the next day, have him stuffed in a suitcase
And if I cant get him then, I give a fuck what your dudes say
Hell be just like Makonnen going up on a Tuesday
Im fucking...
You souffle soft, Ill fillet you for loose change, youre too gay
Fucking get booked, you would sing off keys, thats fucking Robert Goulet
Im Bobby Boucher
Packing a hatchet the Sioux made
Ill fucking scalp em and sell them dreads as a fucking toupee
What to do with this nerd?
Takes an unusual verse
How to befuddle a spitter who makes music with words
But Im from Philly, you know I fuck with the root of the...
The fucking word of The Roots
But today I think I kill him with the root of the words
See Ive never been im-pressed
Its nothing Ill im-ply
My raps make him in-vest
You barely get in-vites, I dont say it in jest
Ill still put you in flight
Youre the shit that they ig-nore
My shit make em ig-nite dawg
If you in court you raising your in-dex
If you in deep you probably gon in-dite
Only whore on-line you spinning on Pintrest
You never been a gangster whos cutting them pin stripes
But when I spit my shit its cleaner than Win-dex
But he cant even cause his chunky ass wind pipe
So I dont give a fuck if he out from the mid-west
His delivery is as gentle as a fucking midwife
Bro I cant even hang with T cause sons stressing
He thinks everything is a drug or a gun reference
Like I said, Molly, Miley and Ninas in the back of the whip.
He said, Pills, coke and a nine? I said, No. Actual chicks.
If I say Crystal and Mary Jane he aint thinking names of women
If I fucking talk about my cell plan
Hes thinking about escapes from prison
Listen
If I say ratchets Im talking about tools
If I say cans Im talking about booze
If Im gon ride its probably a cruise
If I got white its the sock in my shoes
But you acting like your squads snapping
You all wood like a log cabin
And that big arm like Tom Savage
But my strategy is John Madden
You got sound effects in your rounds well then homie you should stop rapping
We in Toronto, Capo, leave it to Scott Jackson
But I mean...
But, but me and T...fucking...
Did brawl once the fucking sound effects were crazy
We fucking went all out it was right in front of his lady
I mean he came out with that chic chic trying to let that big thing ring
But I came back with the sword I was like shwing shwing shwing
Uno Lavos wouldnt cross the boarder to get work from you and he Mexican, thats messed up
J.C. wouldnt dance in the ring with you
E.Ness wouldnt give the Bandz up
So you saying stuff like, Why these black people wanna battle me?
Man shut the hell up
You like Brad Pitt in Fight Club
They got you out here looking crazy beating yourself up
Help us?
What happened when at your dome?
It was your black friends buddy that stood up like, Leave that kid alone!
See, you didnt care if our dads werent at home
Their loyalty was like your real name
If needed them fam to get em/Adam for Rone
Damn wigger
You lying in your voice
You playing Simba
Your N.W.A. CD skip last night at the hotel and I heard you saying nigga
I heard you, you was saying nigga
Scalp you with a scalpel, approach me and Im spraying ya
Have Adams apple surgically removed like a transgender
You a puss homes
That battle with Pay Stay wasnt gay, it just look wrong
Like, are yall fucking for real?
No, are yall fucking for real?
He had you took home
You talking loud, that silencer on that (chic chic) clone
Without tux, you finally get a tie or two to match
When I go at Pat Stay and Rone its on
Its time to stop the show
Breaking news
I knew you was going to come with the typical practical jokes
April Fools
Im spraying tools the rules that the Navy use
But this aint what its taking to
You gonna come to get popped, Taken 2
Save the ooohs
This round, I take the boos
Im playing in school like oooh, he got them new Jordan 2s? Lets take his shoes.
We got older, put mother and daughter in a sacred room
One live, one die nigga, make em choose!
Fuck it, kill yourself for all I know
I point that can at her, that big boy is Ontario
But there aint no where to run though
Now that was a reach, I aint gon lie
But Im reaching for another gun pronto
Drake Started From The Bottom beat, you gon get it from Mahalo 
See, we all know a whole bunch of shit that you could say about me
If I was you, Id have all my shit took away
You could say
Big T, what you know about studying for a test thats a month away?
You had to go to school, your dad made you read a book a day
The whole book a day
No Bs, you only could get As
Cause if you didnt get good grades you got all your privileges took away.
You could be like, Big T
What you know about being mad when McNabb couldnt play
Cause if it was a mistake my dad used to beat my mom ass and I had to look away.
Like, He didnt mean to fumble that last play it was a mistake.
All you hear is (bbbbbrrr bbbbrrr clap clap) Leave her alone dad for goodness sakes!
What you know about Adam having the same face as mine
Cause Im Adam junior and hes Adam senior he had the same face as mine
So if I lose the disgrace is mine
So first place was mine cause you had somebody there to motivate you every time
I wouldnt know about that
QUIET nigga!
Yo check
So I worried theyd paint me simply
If fat jokes were all Id bring for T
But hes the first really fat guy Ive battled so...this is big for me
I mean, these fat jokes are mad heavy
Yall might get mad at me
Shit, I might lose all my fat friends, oh wait I dont have any
So if regular fat people wear big tees with their bathing suits
You take the next level and probably bathe in suits
I mean Id clown him about his outfit but his face looks like its drowning
You dont have a lazy eye you have a lazy face around it
You look like the Teflon Don if he was covered in Teflon
Or a walrus who dipped all of his blubber in Exxon
Fuck a bug, hes killed any mammal hes stepped on
If Biggie saw this piggy he would think he was Dead Wrong
I mean as far as food, what we got today?
Lobster face? Pasta plate?
Hes black and Islamic, what the fuck is he? A chocolate shake/sheik
I mean, youre too fat to walk over subway grates
But youre in the hall of fame with Jared as the Subway Greats
I mean, fucking your blood pressure is higher than the price of a brick
You are addicted to steaks if were talking life on the strip
We would need a whole tray to put ice on your wrist
And your fingers are too fat so you fucking type with a stick
But fuck jokes, Ill use reality to show that theyre lame
The joke would be you probably need two seats whenever you sit on an airplane
The reality would be if you sat next to on me an airplane it wouldnt ruin my night
It wouldnt ruin my flight
It would ruin my life!
Him coming down the aisle with hard steps and short breath Please God do not let him sit here Id be praying with palms clenched
Sit down and your drenched from your breast to your forehead Fuck two seats, lard fest could only fit on a park bench
In case of emergency landing hed need an extra large vest
If he has the window seat, the suns eclipsed by your chest
And Id be hard-pressed to stay Meta like Artest
Because this guy cant keep his side fat off of the armrest
I mean...
I mean its a tight nice little package but I promise all thats real
You are inconvenient to be around, how awful does that feel?
I mean...
I mean his gains could be alleviated
And his pains could be abbreviated
With a diet and exercise maybe tying to be creative
Its really basic but the only time hes creative
Is making tacos with ice cream as a freaking meat replacement
Hes got a million ways to sweeten cakes
But not one way to lean his face in?
Always room for cheese and bacon
But let me guess, the greens were taken?
But people treat it like its a disease a sickness to be mediated
Misleading statements from the media they deviate it
Like its fat shame and I cant take it
Im trying to decrease your weight and that benefits you
So you could show some appreciation
I mean that fact that youre fat
Says so much about you as a man
No long term goals, no perseverance, you cant stick to a plan
You only care about yourself, youre stuck in your selfish ways
And none of your family members care enough about you to help you change
But they say, Big Ts the man like thatll help him magically
Oh course youre the man dawg, you motherfucking have to be
You have to be cool or funny just to get an advantage
Otherwise you wouldnt have a single friend on this planet
I mean, I mean, fucking...
Fat people make less money, they get promoted less
Theyre more likely to be alone or suffer an early death
And I get pissed cause you have kids and your children are gonna grow
And its a tragedy cause being fat is all that theyll ever know
When your daughter was born you probably weighed 355 pounds
If you walked a mile a day since then, hed be skinny by now
So I dont give a fuck if I lose today or fucking lose the race

Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes 
All we do is shop until we drop
All all all all all we do is shop until we drop

If the card declined you need to check that shit and run again
They dont give you limits when you keep that money coming in
Yeah, just fold some paper round the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband until she found out he cheats
Then she filed for divorce and watched that bank account increase
She got a condo with a view, a house with a pool
He son thats 26 but he just went to away to school
She always show me pictures of him, tell me thats a baby
I hope that I never meet him, that nigga look craaaazy

Shorty so nice, I dont mean polite
When I say nice, I mean looking right
And you cant put a price on something looking right
If they ask how much, tell em what its looking like
Everything I buy fly, its like Im booking flights
If I want it Im a get it, that should not be tooken light
And its on everything I got a crazy lady
So money aint a thing, Jay-z, JD
Like Jay-Z lady, its Beyonceing
Supporting your woman goes beyond paying
Watching me ball is like LeBron playing
Im in the Louie shoes you might see Kanye in
They say it aint trickin if you got it, they lyin
I say it aint trickin if you got her, she mine
You niggas aint gotta worry about her, she fine

Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Reppin til my last second through
Done a lot of shit theyll never get to do
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin attention
Ill just say its been a pleasure
Youll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow aint guaranteed, so tonight we gon do it like this
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight Im gon make some money go

Oh yeah, and I know we gon get it
Me and Jeezy bout whatever, shorty, holla if you with it
Even though I want it to this shit don’t last forever
But better late than never, honestly I’d like to say its been a pleasure
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Reppin til my last second through
Done a lot of shit theyll never get to do
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin attention
Ill just say its been a pleasure
Youll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow aint guaranteed, so tonight we gon do it like this
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight Im gon make some money go

Damn a nigga never switch
You should get your cherry bust
Before you fuck around with this!
I buy some Rolexes and pass em out as gifts
And when they tell me thats too much
Im like No, fuck it, I insist!
And then we light it up and reminisce
About the things that we would fix
How the fuck we got this rich?
This is just some inspiration
For young niggas on they shit!
This for my young niggas on they shit for real
This also for the hood stars that I created
Whose booking rate went up right after we dated
Girl you made it for real
Hosting parties with athletes or another rapper
Then they trying to fuck you after
Remember when you was my....bitch!?
My special friend with benefits
You remember how you got here?
Hope to God you aint forget
But the look youre giving me tells me you did

Riding bangin getting throwed in the candy painted low
Chrome grill in front of it
Belts on the back of it, my homie shoes running it
And shorty on the side of me is straight up off the king cover
Don’t care what anybody say long as the King love her
Wish I could tell her that I dont but it would kill her
I just keep on gripping grains dripping stains
Being trilla aint another brother realer
Blowing thousand dollar killer
With the Filipino flow that I just got it from Manila
Bout to snow up in my city
So let me put on my chincilla
In the ‘rari doing donuts like my name was J Dilla
All about the skrilla so just point me to the dealer
Keep the work up in the attic and the money in the cellar

You see us in the back than all you gotta do is tell us
What up, what up

Be the enemy before I help my enemies
Since I left that bitch, man, all she got is memories
Thats because theres only one of me

Bitch, yeah, give that shit up, nigga

Comin from my spot and I dont signal as I back in
If cash is beautiful, then money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfuckin’ centerfold of Maxim
Open to my page and admire my desire
Frequent flyer, I aspire to retire
My voice stands alone even if I’m with the choir
Got a cannon on my hip, but nigga, this is not Mariah
Na, this the record killer for hire
I sleep and eat with the weapon, the beat is all I require
Look I created, despite the niggas that hated
Every single bar gettin first forty-eighted
In the state of euphoria feelin so sedated
The me and bitch the same, we feel so related
Forest Hill estated, all dinners catered
I put a thousand on it, I could probably fuck the waitress
So, wait, just take this
Oone lie at a time, make sure it makes sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit
Drop a four in it and then appreciate The Greatness, nigga
I wrote this verse sittin in my new car
Sometimes where you headed is too far
It’s more about where you are
And I am, everywhere where that you wish you could be
Somebody, somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope
My other niggas move keys, no off notes
But understand rich is how were all ending up

K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac
All that bullshits for the birds, you aint nothing but a vulture 
Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
Youll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah 
Told you that Im leaving, deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah 
I know youre mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now Im finna throw them deuces up
Im on some new shit
Im chucking my deuces up to her 
Im moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
What you mean I aint call you? I hit you when I landed
Im waitin in my hotel room
Seems like were arguin more and its gettin less romantic
Yeah, I think shell be able to tell soon
But Ill fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
Ill fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationships amazin still
I might just put up with the arguin and stay, for real
You lookin bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
Im willin to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that youll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin business
Is mindin your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
Its useless, all this fightin, lets get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around
Im on some new shit
Im chucking my deuces up to her 
Im moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin issues, you fuckin bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, Ima be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch 
Im stupid, but I wont get my drama on
What Im dealin with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk bout “you know who”
I dont know who you talkin bout
Im on some new shit
Im chucking my deuces up to her 
Im moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye bye

Ho, yeah, uh huh
Its Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
Ahahaha, the boys of summer are here man
Ayo Trey, I got something mean for this one boy
Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so Im guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
Im the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But its all eyes on me like Im copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust Im hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you aint got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her
It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about the coupe or my truck
Baby its about the game
Ridin low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
Thats just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl thats how it goes
And Im tryin to find a chick I can meet who aint bout the dough
Cause it aint all about that no more
It aint about the rims on my truck 
Aint about the ice on my watch 
Aint about the coupe or my truck
Baby its about the game 
It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch 
Aint about the coupe or my truck
Baby its about the game 
When you ask why I hustle in the streets thats just who I be
Yo, I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin free
Aint too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all Im still about the game
The haters wanna hate, but it aint no thing no
Because the ladies choose to love me 
It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about the coupe or my truck
Baby its about the game
It aint about the shoes that Ive got
Aint about my dough or my rocks
Aint the life I live, it dont stop

Check 
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, shes like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, Im type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, its quite low
I write so, I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin the ISO
What is about to unfold, no tellin like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
Its only if shes nice though, I aint about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Bens rice throw, that is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world, got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But Id rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I dont really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my 
Let me give you my 
Then call me anytime, Ill bet you Ill be around
Its been a couple weeks out travelin and this broad
Ive seen a couple freaks out battlin for discharge its odd
I try to tell her I aint seen a flier one
Denying some, I have desired some, but that time is done
Now I am gon give it to you straight out of the bottle
No chaser, Ive embraced one in lace, she was a model
Shorty jumped out of the closet even though I mean literal
Her girl made it figurative, or maybe thats what liquor do
Baby, thats the physical, maybe if we spend
A few days all alone on our throne I can get to you
I know you feelin hittin on the road is the typical
But I be in the telly, on your Myspace clickin through
Your pictures, this bruh took a good game
But a fella couldnt Roc, I wanna Dash to my Dame
Im sayin, I know I be playin too much
But Id rather go deaf than loose touch, holla at me
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I dont really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my 
Let me give you my 
Then call me anytime, Ill bet you Ill be around
Round, round, round, round, round
Ayo, the same chick from Dont you have a man? Well...
It all blowed over like Manuel Noriega
She said she wouldnt marry the player
But shes the Tamia to his Grant Hill, man chill
I thought you was my damn seal
In distress, rescue you from the landfill
She said, That aint enough protection
I need Affection like Lisa Stansfield
I guess I cant be mad at this thing that you got
Ill lace you up but I aint tryin to tie the knot, so ah
From me you wont hear no more questions
And please understand that you got my blessings
I hope that your new love opens doors
And is everything that you hopin for
But you cant get my new shit, girl you spoken for
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I dont really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my 
Let me give you my 
Then call me anytime, Ill bet you Ill be around
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like I aint getting service in your area
You be like Nigga get your bars up
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong, I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But Id rather go deaf than lose touch, holla at me baby! 
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I dont really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my 
Let me give you my 

Yeah, look
Me and Sos, we from two different walks of life
Mutually we understand theres a problem, we dont talk to vice
The watch is yellowy-green
Thats sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill but been offered twice
Im awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Inspire no-talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off tonight
Drop you at the house soon as you get off the pipe, man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffins light
But dont try and tell me that a dolphins white
Mislead Drake, that is not at all polite
Its a shame cause thats how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin like no time
Theyll be tryna sub a nigga in like Quiznos
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin heavy on my waist man, Im easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and Im good man Im easy to please
I never lived in a fancy house
I grew up where the guns pop and the child molesters pulled the candy out
So I never really had a chance to escape
Fast forward to 07, aint nothin much changed
The D still scope the crip
And the mics aint really that much bigger than the roaches is
And told the same damn sad story, different publishin
D boys jugglin, single mother strugglin
The media try to cover it
But the Cottonelle two-ply in your neighbors house, Im on some other shit
Me and Drake from two different walks of life
But both understand the pressure from the sharks that bite
My left arms like David Wells
My right arms like Holliday, so Im probably lookin at 8 to 12
For just tossin one of my close friends a bag of chips
Shit, I know they want me locked up
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin heavy on my waist man, Im easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys

Thirty six
I been movin calm, dont start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Dont pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin on me
I dont wanna die for them to miss me
Yeah, I see the things that they wishin on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon tell the story, shit was different with me
Gods plan, Gods plan 
I hold back, sometimes I wont, ayy 
I feel good, sometimes I dont, ayy, 
I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, nessed, yeah
Might go down a G.O.D. , yeah, ayy

And you know me 
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, thered be no me
Magine if I never met the broskies 
Gods plan, Gods plan 
I cant do this on my own, ayy, nah

Ive been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, nah
Might go down as G.O.D. , yeah, wait

Southern Smoke
Its Southern Smoke baby!
 Frank Dukes
 My man Nickelus F
 Ho! Its Drake. Southern Smoke
 This is the remix right here
 So if you got some 
Put ya hands in the air
 Southern Smoke
Now-a-days you sayin that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you dont get shelled
 Make sure your moneys right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Oceans Twelve
This aint Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
Im sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause its a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when its sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasnt for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasnt for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess its kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin a purse
If you pick the wrong mother wholl snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!
I, take time arrange that 
Some, kill just to claim that 
Switch countries exchange that 
You cannot get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right 
Theres, no need to stash right 
Got the same, four Gs from last night 
You cannot take that from me, homie
Money’s the reason my best friend got murdered
So with that and my amounts tryin to make it just to burn it
Milk the game, turn it to butter, look how I turned it
No chick shall get any of dis unless she earns it
Take that dick, put to your lips and insert it
Where the hell is self-respect go when them checks show?
You sleep with them anywhere, hell is your bed for?
You always on your back, what the hell is your legs for?
I know, walk that strip, get my grip
That new Benz’s comin out, put some umph in your switch, trick
Plus I need rims, diamonds and gems
So get up, do the hand job, and some head for him
I got my mind on my money, and my money on your mind 
I’ll blow your mind all over the money that’s on your mind 
So keep my dough off your head, fuck with do on your head 
Now you really got money on your mind, nigga
I, take time arrange that 
Some, kill just to claim that , yeah
Switch countries exchange that , uh
You cannot get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right, uh
Theres, no need to stash right, right
Got the same, four Gs from last night, uh
You cannot take that from me, homie

Shoulda spent more nights
Coulda changed your life
We woulda been alright
All these shoulda coulda wouldas
In her ear one time
Prolly wastin’ my time
Cause she heard it all
Cause she heard it all
Girl, I coulda changed your life
But she heard it all
Well, Ima say it anyway shawty
I’m from the city
Where we were never taught to love
You ain’t gotta be in love to fuck
Girl, I’m just tryna say
I’m from the city, oh
Where the money makes a difference

Know youve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, heres what Ill do
Ill take care of you
Cause Ive loved and Ive lost
Ive asked about you and they told me things
My mind didnt change, I still feel the same
A life with no fun, please dont be so ashamed
Ive had mine and youve had yours, we both know, we know
They dont get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
Cant sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry tears in the pillow case
Lets all get a little taste
Pushing me away, so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didnt break
Ill be there for you, I will care for you
Ill keep thinking you just dont know
Try to run with that, say youre done with that
On your face, girl, it just dont show
When youre ready, just say youre ready
When all the baggage just aint as heavy
And the partys over, just dont forget me
Change the pace and just go slow
Wont ever have to worry
You wont ever have to hide
Youve seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes
Cause if you let me, heres what Ill do
Ill take care of you
Cause Ive loved and Ive lost
Its my birthday, Ill get high if I want to
Cant deny that I want to, but Ill lie if I have to
Cause you dont say you love me to your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that youre following your heart
Cause your mind dont control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, dont be so ashamed
Ive had mine and youve had yours, we both know, we know
Know youve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, heres what Ill do
Ill take care of you
Cause Ive loved and Ive lost
Ive loved and Ive lost
Ive loved and Ive lost

I wouldnt be me if I didnt get a little nasty
Na na na na na na na na

Na na na na na na na hey
They say all I talk about is sex
Verse :
How bout we just pull over and do it where we at
How bout you just lift that skirt up, ooh we can be bad
That place that aint been touched, Im feelin on it
All that juicy fruit, keep spillin on it
Girl, giddyup, get it up take me on a ride to extacy
You dont wanna pump pump then take a nap
You just wanna pump pump, bring it right back
Watch me , Ima heat it up beat it up
Hook:
Know youre tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
Im not coming with the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon feel something unusual
Verse :
I want to do the freaky things you never do
What if we did it while your friends was in the room
Is that too much for ya?
Dont you feel bad, let them see your sexy ass
We can make a sex room wherever we go
Take it to the restroom, they aint got to know 
Watch me heat it up beat it up
Hey, do you hear me girl
Woah watch me heat it up beat it up
Hook:
Bridge:
Restaurants , Cinemas 
On the hood of the car
Counter top , Balcony 
In the jet , On the beach 
Rap :
This that other shit, You know your asked for it
I might just send you some money to get your passport
So you can come to my city, Ill take you all over
And hit you on the balcony just dont fall over
Send me your picture baby you know Ill never leak it
I know you got something recent for someone decent
Why you laughin out loud, Im serious
Bring your girl if shes a little bi-curious
Please, please no story tellin to others
I promise you gon love it
I would never let you down
Feel like I might have perfected all the things that you expected
You gon know it when you bring your ass around
Hook:
Outro:
Do it all different ways or different places
Look at the many love faces your makin
But can you take it

Okay I just got back from another label meeting and
I aint what they looking for I aint what they looking for
I aint really Atlanta I aint really Brooklyn or
I dont fit the appeal for them shows that they could book him for
Straight nigga tryna get in through a crooked door
Barely fittin in cuz a gimmicks what they took him for
But getting doubted caused me to reroute it
To another destination where the people they abouuut ittt!
You ever felt high above it all?
Run your fingers through the clouds like the sky about to fall?
Treat me like Im rich when Im about ball
And think once about the clothing that I buy up out the Mall
Im famous so I get approached fast, Louie and Coach bags
All up in coach class, gem like Topaz, cool like slow Jazz
Dope like coke lines and crack like broke glass
I promise this is me, me
Im not supposed to do this
Im supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you
You, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you
Yea
Ok, Im floating in my zone without a scheduled descend
The rising and the fall was never my intent
I want this shit forever printed in cement
And if I ever sin I promise to repent
Im only tryin to win I aint tryna present
You gotta listen close like its coming through the vent
These rappers cant see me I live behind the tint
And just to get a visual them niggas gotta squint
There I ammmm
Little me in row 23F real reconize real is there none of yall left?
Everybody in the game cant none of yall ref?
And filter out the bullshit the fuck is yall def?
Your now tuned in to the new comer of this summer
The Chris Paul of this fall exist yall - Yea
And is the realist nigga still I?!
A bitch could love you to death and you still die
Ahhh!
Im not supposed to do this
Im supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit is wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
Just keep it between me and you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
Yea
Whats goin on yall?
I wanna thank yall for coming out tonight
I go by the name of Drake
I got my man Slakah The Beatchild here
My man Hazel
You already know we about to rock tonight
So if you with me clap ya hands
Im about to tell you a secret, as long as you can keep it

What we doing Drake? 
What we doing Drake? 
Take your whole bag of candy, leave you in the cold
So bring the ruckus if you under 12 years old
Its 7:58 and now your curfew is pushin
Watch how just like Republicans Im behind the bushes
It wasnt me - if you asked me, thats what Imma tell ya
And Imma eat so much chocolate, my blood types Nutella
Got wanted signs from madd parents, state troopers
Kidnapped Willy Wonka and bitch-slapped an Oompa-Loompa
Give me your Reeses Pieces, give me your Hershey bars
I want your Milky Way, give me that Snickers bar
I would Trick-or-Treat but Im too old now
So I snatch your bag so I dont look like a pedophile
My sticky fingers got all of these mamas mad at me
Were talking stomach aches, restraining orders, cavities
I probably wont have no teeth when Im finished
I dont pay for the porcelains, I just marry my dentist

I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? ’cause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring you to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I’m blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?
Probably one of my realest loves ever
Four page letters, and time is all better
‘Cause time heal whatever
Ima need a moment ’cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, Females are on a regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friend with benefits till we ready
Now ready, Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like “one more chance”, more problems no biggie ah
It’s all good don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or give eachother space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that 
Tell your friends they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?
I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? ’cause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring it to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I’m blunt, but how real is that
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still…
Uh, ain’t no, ain’t nobody like you
Heard you gotta ballplayer, but he don’t excite you
I ain’t the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me bite you
Uh, still a, still a superfreak
You know how it be when I’m rolling in the sheets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Genuine, ’cause I’m the same O G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies
Arguing in Barney’s, fly shit, too much pride to say sorry
Problems ruined like half the day
Number 24, let it fade away
She gotta leave, but she wanna stay
She like, how you feeling babe?
Like, like, shit
I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? ’cause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring you to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I’m blunt, but how real is that
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still
Chorus:
I still got it for ya x6
And even though we let it go, its better that you know
I still got it for ya x6

Put that Christian Dior on a Muslim, she feelin like she was sinnin
Her family lose faith in a genocide, I told em bring em all to Finland
I dont mean to admire you, just passion, Im winnin 
Had to double back up my double-cup, yeah, yeah
You gotta put up out the city, she cant get any closer
Especially when youre driving a bandwagon after
You gotta put em on, she like that
Ayy, I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment 
Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
Cause you got desires
You got that fire and Im not a liar
You had me down on my knees everyday, had to talk to Messiah
Im in that 81 and this that 82, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all of your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin too close to the city
You actin too vulnerable livin this life
I shoulda moved you away from Houston, before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, youre not actin like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the section
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you 
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment 
Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
Cause you got desires
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment 
Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
Cause you got desires
You should have did what you said you wouldd do
You should be movin in silence
See the type girl you hang with, the wildest
Need a better environment
I bought bags to fill up your closet
I pop tags, I know where Im rounded
I do the dashes, get higher than the mountain
You need class to be with a celebrity
So sad, you lookin like charity
What you wanna do? See niggas bury me?
All of my brothers are black, carry me
I cant answer you through the legacy
At the embassy speak, it was like therapy
Bought a Patek Philippe in your currency
Bitches cant keep it real with a nigga movin so desperately
You the one that did the Twitter shit first to see how these hoes react
The only one that can make me feel some way cause I love you back
You wanna be my queen, niggas fuckin on you, think Ima take you back?
Your bags are secured at home, relax
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment 
Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
Cause you got desires
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin around you
California, Santa Barbara, you know, an early retirement 

Took if from signing my own yearbook to booked for the year
Got a condo and I couldn’t even cook for you here
Took it from bs checks to TSX
To people wondering if its the Phantom he gets next
Who knows, its the rabbit its buzzing for real here
The rapper everybody got a cousin he’s feeling
Its kinda ironic you fit with them
Cause they wasn’t really around when it wasn’t appealing
Now its denim diamonds an perfume spraying
Four star rooms are the worst you stay in
What girl that wasn’t me who’s verse you saying
Shit I would never tell you nothing like that
Them other niggas you spend on, cuff em like that
See the difference with me I don’t forget the past
And you gave me nothing so I’m gonna give you nothing right back, like…
Where were you when I...
Would’a loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny I’m the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I…
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
Where were you when I was…
Young, dumb, looking in the mirror
Trying to figure out who Im gonna be this year
Its funny you managed to be around for the present
All puns intended your funds are mended
If I take back the cheddar itll better for both us
No debts owed we can both let go
Before this I could never get a call from ya
Now all texts finish XOXO
But this aint hollywood squares to me
Sweetie I’m far from a hollywood charity
And I bet when you talking to your friends
You messing with other dudes that you probably compare to me
But if its not Drake and one of us wrong you forget my birthday and know none of my songs
You coulda told me before your heart wasn’t in it, fine
But try to get a start at the finish line
Ah
Where were you when I...
Would’a loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny I’m the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I…
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but

How was your night pop?
It was, uh... it was alright. Shits just crazy man. The whole energy out here is just changing, you know, its just getting dark man, quick. Its like mans are on the road it feels like as if anybody is a target, you know, you just dont know where its gonna come from, cant even gauge it man. Its like I go from that, trying to balance that to just balance my own sanity, drinking more, smoking more, you know staying up so late that its early, like fuck. Im not losing it though, you know, Im just venting, Im not like worried, its already too late for these guys trust me, Im just more worried about myself you know, I just gotta come home.
JUNGLE

All the way to the top
Yeah, you do it for the money, and not the honey, you know what Im sayin? Hahahahahahaha
You know what Im sayin?
Part of me wish that I could meet with all you haters in person
They got a lot of feelings for me they just aint certain
How to express themself when I walk into the club
And take stares like the fuckin elevators aint workin, yeah
Cause they know the promoter paid you
You wouldn’t have come if someone hadn’t of made you
You just lookin forward to seein woman that played you
And shittin on the men they get engaged to
I swear it’s like, uh
More confidence and less fear
We can discuss it further when yall manage to get here
Diddy here, O here, Skinny here, Rex here
And we just havin one of those conversations bout next year
Ima kill it I promise this how I know you mad
Ive always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I aint asking for much all I want is the
 I want the money , money and the cars
Cars and the clothes , the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be , I just wanna be successful 
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Yeah

I just put my dick all in this bitch, got her moanin
I just put my dick all in this bitch, you know Im on it
... copped me a coupe , hold up, yeah
I just copped me a coupe, I wrecked that shit, yeah
Thirty racks on me when I pack
Pull the bitch over, I just whack

Damn, another 20 missed calls
I love her and I hate her
Its a funny twist yall
Cant stand her it when she in town
But miss her when she gone
Truth be told
Id rather be with her than alone
But fights break out
And neighbors call 5-0
Screamin you the most foul bitch I know!
Forever mine wherever I go
Sex pistols out die slow
Nah die slower than that
Just co-llapse all over my matt-ressss
Who shot cha that nigga aint finished
So once again I find myself in it 
Just let me take a minute
Round 2 is in the chamber
All you gotta do is spin it
Aim for the heart
Battle of the sexes

They say we killin em all, all, all, all
Hip hops newest and youngest acquisition
If this was you, I wonder what youd do in that position
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference
Try to make em play your shit or try to make em listen
I go from records with Dwele and L.B. and Elzhi
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that Theyll buy
Now Im out in A-Town
They tellin me Trey sound
Its too mainstream if I plan on me stickin around
But the allure of this years Scream Tour has been cuttin all them Jawns that be hurtin the game
I be dreamin bout hoes and doin them live shows
Shirtless, thats why I started to personal train
Dog, personally mane
Im a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they purposeless game
It never feel like its earned when you purchase the fame
Now my thoughts gettin deeper and Im searchin the game
I keep on, on, on, on, on
 Im killin em all, all, all, all
 Im killin em all, all
Im killin em all, all
Yeah
Let me show you how to blast up
Now tell me who is a masta
A mind never wasted
Who grows fasta?
The young and incredible while lightin yo ass up
You look a lil red, we gettin that cash up
See where we from, the 50s are bloody
And the 100 dollar bill is dirty brown, they love me
I mess up my livin room, and studio with my money
A G-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of
My lapel, is custom made
You off the rack shit
Im off the chain, come on
The dogs are loose
And yeah we get our dumb on like San Frisco Bay
With 40 and Mac Dre
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to me or one of my folk
Drakell give you the deal
If bein broke at 30 is a nigga that kills
I guess we somethin like two ice bergs huntin to kill
Keep on, keep on , keep on , keep on 
Look, uh
I used to get em like murda murda
Ol time killin
I wasnt even rappin, spent my whole time chillin
And now the girls like
Its only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place
But pimpin aint easy man and neither is rappin
They one in the same when you need it to happen
My city full of players they just needed a captain
In need of him right now in need of him back then
But back then I was actin
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin
Tryin to prove rappers are intelligent black men
And now whoever chose to back out is back in
They say theres two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told
So grab a spoon fore your soup get cold
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old
So please discover an answer fore proof gets sold
And keep on, on, on, on, on

Try me, I deserve it
Nuh time to have you lurking
Him ah go act like he nuh like it
You know I dealt with you the nicest
Nuh body touch me you nuh righteous
Nuh badda, text me in a crisis
I believed all of your dreams, adoration
You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that youve never seen
Something that youve never been!
Mmmmm!
But I wake up and act like nothings wrong

Look, Im sorry that Im super late
I was drivin here jammin them Lil Boosie tapes
Understand that I do not envision, I hallucinate
Im the type of nigga you could never ever duplicate, but
Lets talk about the babies me and you could make
We could do it anywhere, baby, you just choose the place
I hope Im not being inappropriate
But maybe if I peak under the table, you could show me it?
Let me get a quickie, speed stick, no deodorant
To cover up the smell cause your parents are the nosiest
When you famous all the bitches wanna throw you it
But even with a bunch of women, you could be the loneliest
I tend to ask more than I can give
Or wait whatevers next and just get bored of what it is
Thats probably why Im keepin you around
Was looking for exactly what I found
I just hope you stay down
Babygirl, I hope you rep for me for real
And when they get to stereotypin a nigga
I just hope you stay down, uh
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—
Listen, even if you slightly doubt me
When these bitches start to writin books about me
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay—
Everything about me cataclysmic
Big, obscure on every characteristic
I dont know what youre used to, but Im a little different
Tremendous with credentials, resume is so prolific
Enough of that, despite Im promisin one in the booth
Always been a specialist at messin with the best forbidden fruit
Never did I witness beauty so amazin, get it to the point when I see her, she glowin like an angel with it
But after all the years of doin it, I need an understanding with a woman good with followin my lead
And though she finds it sexy and she loves that Im the power, even in a crowded room, discreetly touching on her private
And when we goin through a moment when we feelin iffy
Believe in shit you hearin while I question if you with me
You see that line of chicks? Lets go around the corner, waitin and hopin you drown, I just hope you stay down
I cant help the women lovin everything about me, why you passin judgement?
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—
I know its hard to trust me, all this money got my baby mama tryna fuck me
I just hope you stay down, uh
I just hope you stay down

For the first time I feel love

Somehow, still, I want you
Crazy how old memories, they haunt you
Didnt have it now like a Saint Laurent shoe
Still tryna figure what point I lost you
Was chasin the wrong thing
Wrong crowd with the drama that they all bring
Its the same song and dance if they all sing
Youre a queen, hope you never choose the wrong king
Is you mine? I aint tryna buy the wrong ring
Both knew that we was more than a long fling
But you got lost in this world, tryna find you
And the streets wont love you like I do 
Ever since I left the city, you
You cant seem to make up your mind
Never wanna be there for me
But you only always take my time 
Ever since I left the city, I, well, I cant deny
Even though I say, I dont care, I still pray for you every night
You know that I got you, better act like you know who
These streets just dont love you like I do
Love you like I do, like I do

The ATL, MIA, LAX, JFK
Luggage all packed and to them I say
Farewell to the pure, amen I pray
You wander the world
You seek what youve lost
Youre waking up every day
The run away, run away girl
I turn and your gone
Youre leaving to chase your fame
The run away, the run away girl
So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on
Your way
Run away girl
Watching it all through the window
And wishing you could make it shatter now
Now that youre here on the other side
Are you sure it even matters
Are you living the dream
Are you telling all your girls that it aint what it seems
Do you strip do you model do you live in between
And look for the split second that you get on the screen like
You wander the world
You seek what you lost
Youre waking up every day
To run away, run away girl
I turn and youre gone
Youre leaving to chase your fame
You run away, run away girl
So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on your way
Run away girl

Fresher than you, fresher than you

Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Straight up

Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work

For my niggas who gon go to Hell and back for me
Ima give ’em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, thats lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like its a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasnt luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you dog
That shit get-get petty, bitch, dont give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now its back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This aint what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why Im your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don’t know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God
I’m here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I havent had a good time in a long time, you know I
I’m way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed 
Im way up, I feel blessed 
Way up, I feel blessed
Look, I aint gon say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we’re back from something
If were back from somethin theres some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I dont need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, Im doing a toast
For niggas that dont really do shit, I swear, yall be doing the most
Stop worrying bout whoevers next
I am just worried bout my mama worrying less
I think Im famous enough, I dont need any more press
I am convinced Im the only one left
Thats still doing this shit, man
Im here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I havent had a good time in a long time, you know I
Im way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed 
Im way up, I feel blessed 
Way up, I feel blessed
My grandma just died, Im the man of the house
So every morning Im up ‘cause I cant let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So Im going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, Im that invested, but you cant attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know thats a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, its only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I
Im here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I havent had a good time in a long time, you know I
Im way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed 
Im way up, I feel blessed 
Way up, I feel blessed
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
Im blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, Im calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, Im gon swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
Im blessed
And I was thinking bout starting up my own school
A Montessori

Haters we never condone em
Penthouse full of some bad bitches, me and my homies gon show em something
It’s MMG
Ridin round in this Lambo, goin ham dog on Collins
And I’m leaning off of that purple shit, so don’t judge me like your honor
I’m feeling so cold
Yeah we riding dirty but the whip clean
But think a couple years ago
I was in a cell when I was 18
And whats up with these new bitches, and why they all wanna fuck so easy
And whats up with these new niggas, and why they all wanna talk so greasy
All these niggas stealing swag
Ive been getting tats since I was fourteen
Tell my bitch throw it in the bag
Twenty-two for the Balmain jeans
Im smoking these niggas they needing nicotine
Rat race, first place famous like a Kennedy
All my diamonds lemonade
Hearts stay below degrees
Too many bitches marry them all, polygamy
Make a waterfall, Yosemite
Highest underrated nigga, I dont need you rating me
Sold out shows way before this shit was BET
Knocking at my front door, bitches trying to peek and see
Last Kings, YMCMB you know the team
Just counted fifty thou in my Waldorf suite
Man, this lifes too fucking easy
Ferrari red all over, call it Santa bleeding
All I care bout is money and the city that Im from
Imma sip until I feel it, Imma smoke it til its done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya

Yeah, I said I’m on one, fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and Imma get that shit

I take time to make that 
Some breakdowns get caked back 
Flip eight times, get eight stacks 
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right 
Theres no need to stash right 
Same four Gs from last night 
You cannot take that from me
Hey yo Im movin on up, excuse a moi, pardon its me
Theres a new chapter to life that Im starting to see
And Ima make and spend money to the hardest degree
And on the low I probably mimic every artist I see
I need a house, a wifey, a nice watch and a lot of cake
I cant lie, theres certain figures I gotta make
And for my family, this a shot that I gotta take
Cause where I live theres nobody as hot as Drake
Which basically means, whos faith in his team
Will resort to new cars, briefcases with cream
Tryna find a space in the jeans for placing the green
And a watch get they attention, the bracelets clean
Im stayin the music, wifey kinda need to be a band lover
I keep it flow, an old school like your grandmother
Im a tan brother, they use rubber bands to keep his money intact, if you dont like it you should ban rubber
I take time to make that 
Some breakdowns get caked back 
Flip eight times, get eight stacks 
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right 
Theres no need to stash right 
Same four Gs from last night 
You cannot take that from me
These days I really cant break 20s, hunnid and make money, money
Every month, the government will take money from me
Make 750, look how quicky I spent that, dont call me broke cause I strictly resent that
Last my P had to flip my the rent, because the tax bracket Im ins is 50 percent flat
All because of Ebay givin me leway, basically do the PayPal, I need a raise now
Seems every time a nigga stop and he eat, I end up always tryna shop and compete
They know a nigga bout it when its in his size and cops it in more colors than Popsicle Pete
Till Im piled to the top with receipts, trust the store and I dont understand less is more
Wanna get em to the point where they owe me, and they gon see Drakes on his JOB, its like...
I take time to make that 
Some breakdowns get caked back 
Flip eight times, get eight stacks 
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right
Theres no need to stash right
Same four Gs from last night

Yeah, its Drake, KC
We was just walking
Just smiling and talking
Then add to my surprise
Got lost in your eyes
This time they were different
And I found what it meant
After I leaned in I helplessly fell in
Help me Ive fallen in love
And now I cant get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that Im in love
In love and I cant see
Whats happening to me
You blinded my thoughts
From what pain and tears taught
See my hearts been broken before
It dont trust love anymore
One kiss from you
I just felt myself fall right through
Help me Ive fallen in love
And now I cant get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that Im in love
Got me hypnotized with your magic spell
I got butterflies, cant control myself
Close my eyes at night and I dream of you
Its true, dont know what to do
Dont stop now
Since I let you in
You showed me how
You showed me how to love again
And theres no reason why
I cant give you a try 
Cause it feels so right
Look, previously mischievous behavior
Was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some considerable degree
Steppin out the house
Tryin to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But ugh, Keshia, Keshia do you remember the old us?
We would never be together, is what they told us
From immature kids to entrepreneur kids
We bought our own dreams instead of the ones they sold us
Keep it a hundred, what they sayin Im a liar for?
Airing laundry, thats what I got a dryer for
What are they even searching through attire for?
Tellin you these stories bout lonely women that I ignore
Callin them out is red rover to me
To them its a dream, its just a rare rover to me
See Im passionate and focused
I dont know how they expect a Scorpio born in October to be, but ugh
Im going in, check
Look, previously mischievous behavior was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin out the house
Tryin to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But now, I need a culprit
I am talking lofts and beach condo adult shit
I am talking all day shopping sprees at the mall with, friends that I ball with, here meet Ts girl, go and get some fall shit
Sweetie I am a tracks demise. I will kill this song until it actually dies
With a military jacket and some pack supplies
I wont say Im the best until the stats arrive
And all these A-list parties you fraternize
Where you cant wear hats inside, its only slacks and ties
But you dont ever act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy until the plaques arrives
Thats why I love you

We the greatest ever nigga
MMG, yeah
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
If findin somebody real is your fuckin problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it
Here it come, there it goes, guess Im rolling up the marijuana
Well known as the boss, its the bottle popping
Talking down, she wanna ball like Cyndi Lauper
I get the cheddar here, baby girl a blood but she kinda cute
Let a nigga gang bang in the found blue 
Red beamer and its brand new
So shout out to the bitches we done ran through
True connoisseur carnivores, to the whores
Yeah you running with the flow, it wasnt yours
All the boss got butter, its all gold
Stalley showed it to me first now fast forward
The land lord my influence, is speaking Jewish
Need to get you some insurance for smoking too much
This shit a movie pick a theater in the crib
And you know I got the pole, we get it in, we get it in
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
If findin somebody real is your fuckin problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it
Speeding in my fast car, reminiscing on the girl that I last saw
And how she cut wood like a hacksaw, wax on wax off man that ass soft
Attached to my fitted, but I get that kitten hat soft
I was jimmy hat strapped when I fell up in that cat: pause
All over my body, me on for my yoning balls had the head down
Tails up like a coin toss rolling up a body
Stretching like Pilate, 110 Maserati
Burning down the highway, burning on some Marley
Could this be love infatuation of the body?
The facts is that Im sloppy with my feelings and its got me
Chasing love at six in the morning, horny as a dog in heat chasing after pony
The streets is lonely, but its just me and the stars
Me and my thoughts, could it be me and the Goddess?
Well if I play my cards right, tarot cards on my dashboard if they re-write
Or leave me right back to my queen tonight, right?
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fuckin problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
If findin somebody real is your fuckin problem

Alright, well alright
I say I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in ya starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A picture wont do me Justice League in this bitch
I’ma do me trust this
Patience little label nigga you wont rush this
I got the hammer money sweetie you can’t touch this
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario
Coming through ya stereo
Plus my girlfriend booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motha fucking Mario
Yeah, and Polow isn’t at my session
Mr Anticipation Ima keep you niggas guessing like
Ok ok I’m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I’m home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn’t condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE
I’m up too high somebody come get me down down down down
Said I’m up too high somebody get me down down down down
Look, my ex girl said she done dating black guys
She shoulda listened when her white friends advised
Not me I make your battle ships capsize
Get soaked get wet get baptized
I got the full package a nigga complete
I get bread and eat tracks like lunch meat
Sue me and Ima put you on front street
Probably get your records pushed back like front seats
I’m much more then you fathom he would be
And aint too many niggas that I’d rather be than me
I guarantee the women getting at him would agree
That he should go ahead and put a patent on his g
And I swear these niggas gassed up even though the price is high
I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly
You know my coupe sit super low
Top slipped off like Janet at the superbowl
Ok ok I’m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I’m home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn’t condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE

Late night when she need your love
Call you on your cellphone
Late night when she need your love
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
I know when your hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
Ever since I left the crib, you, you
Started feeling sorry for yourself now
Its crazy how you had me feeling left out
And everybody knows you left me stressed out
Ever since I left the crib, you
Started caring less and going out more
Hanging with these girls all on the dancefloor
Chilling with these girls I never seen before
I never seen before
You used to call her on her cellphone
Late night when you need her love
Call her on her cellphone
Late night when you need her love
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
Ever since I left the crib, you, you, you
Dont seem to care about who you with now
You got me feeling like I did you wrong
Going places that you dont belong
Ever since I left the crib, you, you, you
You got exactly exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your blackbook
Chilling with these girls I never seen before
I never seen before
I used to call you on your cellphone
Late night when I needed your love
Call you on your cellphone
Late night when you need my love
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
These days all I do is wonder if youre bending over backwards for someone else
Taking Patron shots with someone else
Doing things we did, getting freaky with someone else
You just need someone else, I cant be by myself
Oh, why you never alone? Always with these hoes
Used to be at home, be a good man, you were in the zone
You should just be yourself, right now youre someone else
She used to call you on your cellphone
Late night when she need your love
Call you on your cellphone
Late night when she need your love
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
You know the love that we shared
You know what we had was rare
You know the way that I cared
And I gave up, you wasnt there
Niggas be lying, two at a time
I heard voice up in my line, line, line
I heard voice up in my line
Thought you were mine, so out of line, line, line

Look I know girls love Beyonce, girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing, and shawty you ain’t no different
These days it’s hard to meet women, feel like my love life is finished
I’ve been avoiding commitment thats why I’m in this position
I’m scared to let somebody in on this, no new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go, you got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it’s just me, but I am not alone
But if you’re alone then, say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say, “Baby, I love you”
If you ain’t running games, say my name, say my name
You actin’ kinda shady, baby, why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Look, I know girls love Rihanna, girls love to play with your mindset
Girls always find out the business, and baby you aint no different
I think Ive met a few women, who know the meaning of winning
So Imma take one and leave here, cause girl we dont have to be here
Im bout to let somebody
In on this, old friend, she is new friends
She knows me from way back when I
Know she knows my ways
The way I was from way back then, these people wont believe the years
Weve spent before as friends, now were together she can say
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say, “Baby, I love you”
If you ain’t running games, say my name, say my name
You actin’ kinda shady, baby, why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Yeah, uh... Say my name, say my name, cause those other men are practice
And this ain’t no time for actin’, and this ain’t no time for games
And this ain’t no time for uncertainty, and this ain’t no time for locking your phone
And not coming home and startin’ some shit when I’m in the zone
This is why I’ve been saying, no new friends, no no no
You know how this shit goes, this is not four years ago
Time escapes me, now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys ‘round me saying, “Get money and fuck these hoes”
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I’m just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that’ll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with cause we don’t wanna hide no more
Plus you’re not shy no more; neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I’m not alone, even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone, let me make you say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say, “Baby, I love you”
If you ain’t running games, say my name, say my name
You actin’ kinda shady, baby, why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name

Uh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Counting cash every morning before I leave home 
Family I love
Don’t want to leave this world alone
So before I leave home I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Before I leave home I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Yeah, red ribbon, ducking Feds til we pass out
Birdcage, duck the shine til they let him out
Theres more money now, and we done flipped the draught
Hella choppers, clip pulled, nigga, Junior out
Gd up, I took it from the G-code
Presidential suites, with this cash flow
Uptown gangsta, VL hustla
Third Ward general, Young Cash Money
Before I leave home, I kiss my babies, hope I return safely
Knowin the odds against me, these devils, they tryin to break me
Im still loyal, my habits became lavish
Dreams of new endeavors, pub deals and owning masters
And my homeboys, aid to my conditions
I made em all managers, execs and assistants
And most of em don’t understand, some won’t listen
We might fall off, throw fits and get missing
But youre still my dawg, ha, and my big homie spoil me
I feel cause I’m the youngest, he expects a little more from me
So I try to stay humble, and if you can see my vision
You can see us Cash Money til the motherfucking ending
Brisco
Uh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Counting cash every morning before I leave home 
Family I love
Don’t want to leave this world alone
So before I leave home I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Before I leave home I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Uh, YMCMB baby 
Before I leave home, kiss my girl on the cheek and then I say a prayer
If looks was bullets, I woulda been dead from stares
I bypassed the elevator and I took the stairs
Now the hard work got me ridin in Bentleys and Lears
Homie Im so prepared, on point like infrareds
I live my life, so to die, I ain’t never scared
And when I drop, Im not gon flop, Im no Andre Ware
I cant see you haters, guess my visions impaired
My niggas already there, yes we done got that title
You other rappers losing weight, minus the lipo
Breath of fresh air, pump lung money
Cat scan say Cash Money, heart bleed Young Money, one hunny
Yeah, Twist! Young Money
Before I leave home, well mannered, nice, respectful young man
Momma taught me well but daddy taught me through a jail cell
Raised as a prince and Young Money then took me in
Made it official, YM youngn, CMB, whats happenin?
Yeah, I gotta do it for my hood
See before I stepped off the block, I told all them niggas I would
Let’s do it for the OC, I put in work out on TV
And step one over a G, now put your hands for lil old me, yeah

Loyalty is all I know
Chyeah, stay true to my team 
YMCMB a-a.k.a the greatest 
Yeah, that’s why they hate us 
Went from layaway to rocking all the latest, fashion
Name a model chick I ain’t smashing 
New cars for all my homies when I bring that cash in 
Never had my father in my life, he was a deadbeat
Moms worked two jobs to keep Jordans on my feet
Now that I’m on, aint shit to worry bout
I bought my momma a mansion and moved the damn south
Now what you talking bout? Got my Bugatti on the way Stunna
Money coming in fast like the Road Runner, Bow!
Whistle for my family, my label and my set
Its Young Money til my day the death, tell the rest take a rest
Thoroughbreded and blessed, my grind stressed
Sometimes yet nevertheless, a youngn shining with the best
Promised my momma one day I’ll be a rhymer, she left
But I love her so much, it’s like she never took a step
Reality showed me them colors that some of us couldnt
Look at you now that we all what you thought, some of us wouldnt
Said he gettin that dough right, ready jetting from police
Petty better than rolled dice, some cold nights, they deadin us, no light
But Im here now, and we here like something, nothing compared like
CMB, I’m privileged in this legacy, that’s real life
My brothers keeper, protect me from my friends Lord
My enemies’ll bleed ya, choking off anesthesia
Throw my signs high, Im recognized worldwide, worldwide
I’m in it to get whatever it cost me, it’s true loyalty
Uh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Counting cash every morning before I leave home 
Family I love
Don’t want to leave this world alone
So before I leave home I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Before I leave home I pray to God I won’t

Yea!
Webby
Bars are still on me man
I just keep going
CT where you at
Yea, its like that
See Im a beast
Always have been, always will be
Hungry, a seven course meal couldnt fill me
Wanna come and step to the flow then fucka feel free
I can make a lyricist look like Lil B
Been in the game for a minute under your radar
Building my momentum for the moment that Ill take charge
My reflection still the same like spelling racecar
Now Ive just come far enough to overcome the race card
Let me break it off proper
Freestylin to your chick, yea take it off mama
Im a professional showing you who really hotter
Gotta smaller chance of beating me than finding Jimmy Hoffa
Got a lot of people rolling with me how is it a shocker
That I made it to the top, spittin out this molten lava
But now Im fryin rappers up like some cala-mari
Sorry, Im chewin any beat like a piranha
With the weed up in my paper or up in a Philly, fuck it
Until Im on a beach with a margarita like Jimmy Buffet
I be spittin these flows, time to really get it man
Snappin like a gorilla wearing a silly band
Like a tattooed grizzly
Sick, representing Raccoon City
Playin these shows, then I smash two bitties
Blazin these flows til I stack two milli
Came up in the game like a certified hustler
Pedal to the metal til Im burning my muffler
Fuck ya, everyday I stay smoking
My jar is ajar yea keep that shit open, potent
They cant measure up Im too tall yo
Choke em, murder on the mic and now they all know
Frozen, spit it so cold that I cause snow
You gon need a sweater and beanie like waldo
Mother fucker I am that dude
Who else could pull off these Super Mario tattoos
I got these other rappers salty like cashews
Cause Im bad news, for my competition, thats true
Comin through, my dude, I live limitless
Sick, achoo, I proved I spit vigorous
Hating on me while I bruise your chicks clitoris
She was into it and I was into her, get it bitch?
Kid Icarus, flying through the clouds
With a bottle full of liquor and a pocket full of loud
G-g-go across the country and Im rockin every crowd
Im a dog, one hundred deeds of Eddie McDowd
And Im a spit my damn flows, suburban commando
Call me Rambo, backpack on like Banjo
Kazooie, truly in charge like soprano
And Jacks at the head of the table of Samcro
My mind wanders while Im writing a free-verse
And this weed only makes my A.D.D. worse
But Im coming with the bars let the beast work
Thats why your little sister got a Webby t-shirt
Rocking, dope hip-hopping
Full speed with it and I never plan on stopping
Italiano on the mic so yo he fucking mobbin

Got a couple nicknames
...know your bones aching
Sometimes you light headed...
Like a bluesman
...the offer you give me was preposterous
Papi, this bird wont fly, you sold me an ostrich
Im just another nigga tryna keep his money up
Ill wipe that smirk off your face, you think its funny, huh?
I aint playin my nigga, go ahead and giggle
But bullets dont tickle

We are, we are
Not your ordinary fami-mily
But we can all agree that
We are, we are
Close as close can be
We are are are are 
We are are are are 
We are are are are 
We are, Family
So it dont matter what it looks like
We look perfect to me
We got every kind of love
I feel so lucky indeed
They can keep on talking
It dont matter to me cause
We are, we are family
Family, we are, we are
Ham and Cheese
No! Its we are family
Nah
Ok, so the links in our chain makes us strange
But really they make us stronger
And I wouldnt replace not a thing
Mother or father 
Cause we
Cause we come from everywhere 
Searching for ones to care
Somehow we found it here
We found us a home
We are, we are
Not your ordinary fami-mily
But we can all agree that
We are, we are
Close as close can be 
We are are are are 
We are are are are 
We are are are are 
We are, we are
Family
Family
Family
We are, we are

Girl you’re so kind, I think you’re the best
You’re an angel not a devil when you’re in that blue dress
With the girls I find they always seem to fail my tests
Or rather I fail her tests cause I can’t do long-term like the rest
I’m a player I confess, it barely takes two secs
To get her to leave her ex within three hours were near sex
With my hands I caress, her chest, her soft nice flesh
But at my age I can’t rest, only tension is a stress
Pretty girl in your bedroom, chilling out with no makeup on
That’s when youre the prettiest, girl please don’t take that wrong
But you will only trip if I went and brought R-Patz along
Kristen Stewart was holy fit, then those photos got snapped upon
I know I preyed upon those older girls, those out of this world
Now I’m going back down to Earth, fuck all the shit that’s stirred
I’m truly a find, I’m your fantasy in disguise
They say love is blind, girl you’d better close your eyes
Call me crazy shit at least youre calling
Feels better when you let it out dont it girl
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Last Valentine’s Day I met a girl named Renee
We were in love by May, then she found out about April
So she chose to March, damn another broken heart
Don’t blame her, she can’t take a part, it’s my fault I say
Girl now you know all of my past relationships okay
Don’t act with me, you left that old cast on the ship today
Let’s take a holiday, to Las Vegas or LA
Or somewhere just to sit and watch boats by the bay
When you’re young your looks are such a blessing
But a curse, because a boy can’t look at you for five seconds
You’ll just feel insecure, I’m so sure
But that fear can be cured, cause girl I’m the cure
Thats my lure, the man who dont do killing
Except lyrically, but personally is just into romantic feelings
Baby tell me your inner thoughts and your deepest emotions
The next thing you see is an ecstasy explosion
Call me crazy shit at least youre calling
Feels better when you let it out dont it girl
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right

Im still fly Im sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings

S550 navigatin where I gonna be
P.A.G. mother fucker dont forget the E
Rep T dot till they bury me
Automare the wrist red diamonds in the necklace
Been getting checks while you rappers stay checkless
Real street nigga feel free to do a checklist
They dont really make em like me
Had to give you a second to breathe
Nigga ballin still a hobby and I do that with ease
Im bout to catch pneumonia because my neck stay freeze
Im in the west indies
A 100 grand on a cheap white tee
Im the man in my city they demand at me
Nigga I rep for my city like a football team
Im fly like the New York Jets be

Yep...
Uh Huh
And then it comes to me, like an epiphany
(Its over, over
Yeah, Its over, over)
Second night in a row
You didnt come home
Im watching my phone
Waiting for it to ring 
Sitting in the house
On the couch with the TV on
All night, all alone
Every time, same old thing
So I think Im just about over being your girlfriend 
Im leaving , Im leaving
No more wondering what youve been doing
Where you been sleeping

The next morning
To find me smiling

So I think Im just about over being your girlfriend 
Im leaving , Im leaving
No more wondering what youve been doing
Where you been sleeping

Like an epiphany
How about if I just leave?
So I think Im just about over being your girlfriend 
Im leaving , Im leaving
No more wondering what youve been doing
Where you been sleeping
 Im leaving
 Im leaving

Ice in the necklace light skinned and hectic and all these simple things got a man braggin
And boastin a little never drank much in the past but now they got the kid toastin a little
So cheers to the fact you here in the track you shoulda been shotgun his career in the back
And his two month lease expires right now knew I shoulda got me a truck with two front seats I assume its
Done Im lookin at my passenger side I realize that theres room for one oh
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cause I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now theres no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now theres no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Now a days you be all cried out no more tears no more planes cause you all flyed out
Need the lord in your life on a Sunday no more fashion nomore spendin your life on the runway
Deal with it you hardly can all this hype around Drake whatever happened to Aubrey Graham
Well its her he’s needin you gotta say leave in the word but I know leavin has crossed your mind
You jealous of some autographs I often sign I try to make it to dinner never often time
But I often find myself hearin your voice you said you never felt a touch soft as mine
I was sayin how the range and the loft is mine had to change in the planes and the porche is mine
Its a deal I was forced to sign but I never imagined that youd end up fourth in line no
Shes got a feelin lonely 
Like she dont even know me 
I thought that she would be the one for me but now I see that
If I could turn back the hands of time she would be mine
You’re on my mind girl lets rewind it back
Look this for that girl that you use to see for anybody that want it how it use
To be all the love afection and all the cash I wanna rewind but we movin forward fast
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cause I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now theres no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now theres no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
And I adore all the pictures that everyone in the media is dyin for
Back when there was one camera to smile for
There was only couple things I could buy you compared to now where Im kinda like heres a thou
Drop grands through appear in style but I could still be chillin in sweat pants and a stainless ring
Without you I havnt gained a thing oh
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cause I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now theres no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now theres no time I see so one plus you and minus me

I Promise, I try College
Did it but I quit it they couldnt define knowledge
For me, I got it, So I’m honest
He living, Spitting Wisdom with some of the top artists
Who are not flawless, but my part is
Yet they dont see what Im doing is not 
They like, Promise, why bother
Well living in the sewer, it’s filled up with hot garbage
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me
If this dont sell, Imma make it sell
And criticisms invited, I take it well
My savings account got a vacant smell
And priorities shift when you take a L
Every time I feel like leaving
Somebodyll play Comeback Season
And thatll give me enough of a reason
To stand outside trying to jingle my keys and
I guess Im attached to her
Cant fathom going back to a bachelor
When youve been in a Range since you started high school
It’s hard going back to the Acura
Yeah, yeah
So Imma stick around as the rain trickle down and the cars get sold
These rappers is all thickle but a ways it could sound
Full of loud and go and put her face to the town
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me
You got me
And you got me
And you got me
When I said I’m not a rapper its not cause I am
It’s cause my momma said Im not like them
I dont look like them
I dont act like them
Only way you know I rap is if you see me rappin’
And I am the truth I cant lie
Hand on the bible in the booth with punch lines
And New York City dumb high
Too much champagne
Threw it up like gang signs
You wanna know if you got me?
Then watch me
But watch me through a train, I
Cause I am Sacario
The same guy
Who flow like
Flow like agua
We dont like no fake, nada
Rappin ass actor,you need an Oscar
And the world know who I are
Why you think Promise featured a pop star?
Sacario
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me

A plethora of fine freaks trailing right behind me
Killin shit dead, turn the club to a crime scene
Pocket full of money like I run a crime ring
Million dollar chain, everything shining

Bunch of young hoes know Chinese

And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in, and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I’m all about “I” give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that “wine and dine”
Try to check me and I’mma have ‘em checkin’ pulses
They say chose wisely, thats why I was chosen
Rocking like asphalt, its the cash fault
Looked in the face of death and took it’s mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face South and her ass North
But I’m Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on my dick and do a full split!

Niggas hatin’ they can’t stand the fact I’m getting fetty
Niggas waiting for me to fall and i know this plenty
So i sit back and i relax and i just sip this Henny
And stack my cheese and watch these rats cause they stomachs is empty
Young niggas gettin’ slain all over some skrill
Goes to show you’ll do anything for a dollar bill
Dig a grave get a gun
And a plot to kill
Shit i donno what to say

That’s not really you that’s just who you portray
I want money
You want the fame and radio play
Hoppin out that thing and they makin that radio face
Fat nigga kick back lots of food on my plate
I traded in the pork and beans for a piece of the steak
I aint tryna look back aint no foot on the brakes
I think my phone’s wire tapped listen in for the jakes
Fat nigga I’m raising the heat
So the sun is ma son my thinking is deep
You reap what you sow and you sow what you reek
I remember growing up I had holes in my sneaks
Mama sent me two socks it was cold on my feet
Pops barely knew him only see him in pictures
Mom’s a pastor I grew up knowin the scripture
With a ripped shirt on the strip til the nigga got strip searched
The world is mine
I think my name should be Atlas
Makin hits like I leave on the clay for the crouches
My traps pumping your traps as dry as a cactus
I wanna cheat on my girl with a actress
Im tired of hidin that dope under my mattress
Kill it i did it for practice
I say fuck chasing bitches imma chase my dream
Cash rules everything im loving my CREAM
Money is the object should i get it any means
Got a circle full of soldiers man
Im loving my team
It was all a dream
None like biggy tho
Smoked out my mind but im steady blowin fifties tho
Always on point like I’m standing on my tippy toes
Loyalty is a must but some niggas never get it tho
And that’s the rule that imma live by
Watching for the snakes some niggas be tryna get by
Party hard and you roll blunts and tryna get high
They copy all your swag and fit it in to make em look fly
I really wanna know why
The question still remains
Did I ever spend the money that I managed to have saved
All these bitches wanna fuck me they see money in my veins
And this pressure on my shoulder got me feelin goin insane
But I’m good
I be out grindin while you niggas sleep
I remember days when I was grindin and I aint never sleep
Posted on the block while I be up and down the fuckin streets
Gotta lot of issues now Im tearin on the fuckin beat
Lamborghini sit back feelin merciealgo
Table full of models and bottles surround the cop doe
Shawty dancing im throwing hundreds she screaming tato
Its a party a celebration wherever i go

Bad bitch beside me shes just rolling up a spliffy
Hop up in the whip, hit the clutch, doin sixty

Define fast, cause I can speed it up, and make it last

Be in the studio, pray Ima be rich 
In place with my next bitch

Top 100 making niggas mad 
Pull up to the function, Benjis in my bag

You might think youve peeped the scene
You havent, the real ones far too mean
The watered-down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, its awful blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addiction
Well, gather round, children, zip it, listen
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
Thats me the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Mi no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You aint got no fuckin Yeezy in your Serato? 
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
Im just a Chi-Town nigga with a Nas flow
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
Can we get much higher? 
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh 
Oooh!
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, Im the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But whats worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, thats why your wins low
Dont make me pull the toys out, huh
Dont make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines
And then they make noise
Can we get much higher? 
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh 
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
Saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldnt spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris
Can we get much higher? 
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Can we get much higher? 
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh 
Oh

Local fire departments are working hard to control this situation. We are working to bring you more details in the hours to come
- First rule in this world baby, dont pay attention to anything you see in the news
Aint no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
Im on the edge, so why you playing? Im saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing, Ive foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin for the love of ballin
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded

All of the lights
Lights, lights
All of the lights
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want yall to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
Until its Vegas everywhere we are 
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
Somethin wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
Im heading home, Im almost there
Im on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university
, lights
Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights 
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life every night 
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want yall to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
Uh
Uh
I love it, though
I love it, though, huh, you know?
Uh, put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know Im preachin to the congregation
We love Jesus, but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We aint married, but tonight I need some consummation
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her makeup, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess its rubbin off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
Im looking at her like, This what you really wanted, huh?
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, its summertime
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know Im preachin to the congregation
We love Jesus, but she done learned a lot from Satan
Satan, Satan, Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We aint married, but tonight I need some consummation
When the sun go down, its the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors thatll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Dont leave while youre hot, thats how Mase screwed up
Throwin shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
Thats Dior Homme, not Dior, homie
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
- Your girlfriend is really beautiful
- Thank you
- Do you know shes a bird?
- Nah, I never noticed that
- I mean like, leave the monkey in the zoo
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been puttin up with my shit just way too long
Im so gifted at finding what I dont like the most
So I think its time for us to have a toast
Lets have a toast for the douchebags
Lets have a toast for the assholes
Lets have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Lets have a toast for the jerk-offs
Thatll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
She find pictures in my email

See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know thats what Im good at
And I always find, yeah, I always find

You been puttin up with my shit just way too long

Twenty-four seven, three sixty-five, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, alright, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs?
Haha, knock it off, Neimans, shop it off
Lets talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You cant blame em, they aint never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you cant accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
Im just young, rich, and tasteless, P
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you knew of that advantage
Cause you could blame me for everything
And I dont know how Ima manage
If one day, you just up and leave
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been puttin up with my shit just way too long
Im so gifted at finding what I dont like the most
So I think its time for us to have a toast
Lets have a toast for the douchebags
Lets have a toast for the assholes
Lets have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Lets have a toast for the jerk-offs
Thatll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

Turn the level up if you wanna 
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin life like we won the sweepstakes, what?
We headed to hell for Heavens sakes, huh
Well, Ima levitate, make the devil wait, yeah
Whose fault?
Lets play the blame game, I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure
Lets call out names, names, I hate you more
Lets call out names, names for sure
Ill call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure

Im up in the woods, Im down on my mind
Im building a still to slow down the time
Im up in the woods, Im down on my mind
Im building a still to slow down the time
Im up in the woods, Im down on my mind
Im building a still to slow down the time
Im up in the woods, Im down on my mind
Im building a still to slow down the time
Im up in the woods, Im down on my mind
Im building a still to slow down the time
Im up in the woods, Im down on my mind
Im building a still to slow down the time
Im up in the woods, Im down on my mind
Im building a still, down the time
Im lost in the world, been down my whole life
Im new in the city, and Im down for the night
Down for the night, said shes down for the night
, ooh
Im lost in the world, been down my whole life
Im new in the city, but Im down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night
Youre my devil, youre my angel
Youre my heaven, youre my hell
Youre my now, youre my forever
Youre my freedom, youre my jail
Youre my lies, youre my truth
Youre my war, youre my truce
Youre my questions, youre my proof
Youre my stress and youre my masseuse
Ma-ma-se, ma-ma-se, ma-ma-ku-sa
Lost in this plastic life
Lets break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms
Still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms
Still get laid, yeah, yeah, yeah
Run from the lights, run from the night, run for your life
Im new in the city
Down for the night, down for the night, down for the night
Im lost in the world, been down my whole life
Im new in the city
But Im down for the night, down for the night
Down for the night
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America? 
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Im lost in the world, been down my whole life
Im new in the city
And Im down for the night, down for the night
Im lost in the world, been down my whole life
Im new in the city
But Im down for the night, down for a night
Oh-oh, get down
Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People dont even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because Gods whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often-entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-doom
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary codenames that preceded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
In the mother countrys crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if theyll have you
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

He dont try at all through
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know Im gonna be with you
So Ill take my time
Hi, my name is
What? My name is
Who? My name is
Abra, abracadabra, abracadabra
She bangs, she bangs
Oh baby, when she moves, she moves
What do you want from me?
Why do you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why arent you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Talk to me baby
Im goin blind from this sweet-sweet cravin, whoa-oh
Lets lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin well eat cake by the ocean 
Walk for me, baby
Ill be Diddy, youll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Lets lose our minds and go crazy crazy

Pay attention, its on
Staring at my city lights through the plane window as I write this song
Have faith, when I do it
I’ma do it bigger than they think
I dont just flow I over flow I be filling up the sink
Like I left the water on I run this bitch if anybody ask
Aint much change since high school
Niggas still be in and out of class
S class or the brand new CL5 on them haters
Black paint, chrome trim same color as the logo for the raiders
I just said that cause Im out in California in the studio with Tez
You should give us credit niggas killin people we can be all doin that instead..
But we not, we just kill the summer every single time I come around
Never chase hoes but we do we laugh at them niggas tryin to run em down
Not I, not me, YMOB, call jaz, call c
Bet both of them would agree
Get viewed, get judged, get booed, get loved
Shit get done round here, do you, not us
Im gon do what I want
Cause this life’s made for living
You got to know nothings for sure
Faith in the stars
Im gon do what I want
Cause this life’s what I’m given
Gotta keep my faith in the dark clouds
Once upon a time I met
On this cold explosive dosage she wrote this
But tell me who chose this
Sin city’s innocent really when its inside my mind
And co-sign with a rhyme and a big pen
Once again it’s an even odd
Can’t applaud with one hand
Can’t be God with one fan
Or can you stan you
If not pastor jackson daniels rip that hit that
Now I sip that lightly when I’m on my mic tightly
And I write nightly like Spike Lee
Let me break it down
I been having a maid since the 8th grade with a fade
Rapping by the swings
And the bell never really rings
Class in session there’s no recession
For this upper echelon mic testing its
K-dash-O-S F-R-E-S-H in the place
With a grace in and outta space
Mind that gotta race
Don’t be something that you really not
Sabotage the universal plot
When the planet earth rock gets hot
From the sun don’t get got just get God yeah see that

Screamin bout what she need, oh
I done got this call a thousand times
Im leaving, rushing to see, ooh
I got the sirens on
She says shes home alone
Until I get there girl
Stay on the line
Its an emergency
Im rushing there to handle mine
Its an emergency
Cause we aint got a lot of time
I gotta save her, if Im any later
Somebody might get there before me
Emergency, that 911s for me
Emergency
When I got there, put her on the floor
She leakin but she still breathin, ooh
Give her mouth to mouth a little more
Repeat it to show her I mean it, oh
I think I know whats wrong
She wont be here for long
Girl, I just cant lose you
So hold on, please
Its an emergency
Im rushing there to handle mine
Its an emergency
Cause we aint got a lot of time
I gotta save her, if Im any later
Somebody might get there before me
Emergency, that 911s for me
Emergency
Its a good thing that you called me when you did
Cause you were slowly fading and wasnt gon make it
Im your doctor, see, these tools Im working with?
I need to operate, I need you to be naked
I can feel your heartbeat, uh, uh, oh
Beatin like its so deep, uh, uh, oh
Give up on you never
Ill make it better
Its an emergency
Im rushing there to handle mine
Its an emergency
Cause we aint got a lot of time
I gotta save her, come any later
Somebody might get there before me
Emergency, that 911s for me

You better cuff yo chick
When you see us out nigga
You better cuff yo chick
You better keep her close to ya
You better cuff yo chick
You better grab her tight cuz you know we got millions for real
You better cuff her like a cop
Every time you see bow wow wow wow come around
She love my swag
And she already know how a young nigga puts it down
She said she want a baller, not a bench warmer
You aint even in the game yet
Cant keep yo broad, you so lame, damn where yo GAME at
And if we in the club you better cuff yo girl super tight
Cuz it just might be your girl who end up in my room tonight
Big pimpin, no simpin, you know just how I does it
Take yo girl, in front of you, and you aint gone do nothin
She want me to take her home, she blowin up my phone
Even got, you can get it all on her ringtone
You girl so out of pocket, you know that she be boppin
She know we ballin, so she wants to ride my Houston rocket
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
Would you please take them handcuffs off of her
Cuz theres so many things I could offer her
Tell her dead that and I got the coffin bra
Im sorry for your lose it must be awful huh
My money tall, yours is like a dwarf so uh
We kick it, Im down like its 4th and uh
I think she wanna give me head, how thoughtful huh
You see me in new york, see me in LA
See me in miami, see me in the A
Might see me in houston, or see me in the bay
But its gonna be hard to see me with that nigga in the way
No it aint drizzy, its ya boy em dolla
No I aint rich, but cuff yo chick by the collar
Cuz if a little nigga like me tryna holla
Then I gaurentee yall breakin up tomorrow
I know she your everything, I just feed her protine
Beat it in the bed sheets, and put her in a deep sleep
And when she wake up she always askin for a repeat
I know she rep the A but I put her on my B-team
I aint gonna sell a dream, but the last girl I sold D
I had her relapsin like a fiene
Nino Brown type, what she want in her life

Look nigga I can murder anything
Retro, techno, electro, slow flow, fast flow
Hottest in the metro
I spit hurricanes
Copy that like an echo
On my Flo-Rida shit tellin everyone to get low
Respect me or die thats the stance that Im taking
A prince but a story is a legend in the making
Cause few niggas spit it with the temperature of Satan
On my Betty Crocker shit you can say a nigga caking, waiting
Summer opportunity escaping
Right through the cracks of a sticky situation
My balls reach stars tell these niggas who they facing
Who the fuck I gotta battle
Four or five mic rating
The upper echelon
Top of the totem you looking at the best
Tell these magazine to quote em
This next bars for haters you still dont know em
I dont got enough room
So get the fuck off my scrotum
Go for the gusto
Built for the hustle
Mixtape murderer still dont gotta adjust though
Tryna be a mogul like Jay, Puff, or Russell
The floor has warm machines made for Hercules muscle
Nervous, you should be
Born where the hood be
Good be a legend
Baby girl I could be
You can be
Find the exit once you find your panties
Its Black market ATF
Who fucking who with the family, nigga
Know more, ask less
All verses get dummied like crash tests
I say your favorite rappers subpar at best
These whack niggas couldnt find me with an address
Yes, guess whos back at it
Stage an intervention, its apparent Im an addict
Balling isnt my hobby its more like a habit
These niggas acting like every day is the Sabbath
My life move faster then a leopard sprint
Round the world got a lot of spots like leopard print
And Im fresh like peppermint
Always claim Toronto most of them are scared to represent
Cause success weve never had it
Many came close but never managed to grab it
It must be an omen
The curse so tragic
Til they give me a Grammy

Damn V-O, sounds like you got a lot of niggas mad at you bruh. Guess thats what happens when uh, you a R&B Diva tryna live a rappers life. You know what Im saying. But um, if you really want it with me man I got you, Imma show you what it is to get exposed, I hope Im on key, hahaha
The V-O-Y Im talking to you
And both them record deals that aint never go through
OK Voyce, we know you was a snitch
But you dont get your boys back like that
Still need a ride, you aint gettin paid
And Taj got you at them shoots wearing pink shades
OK Voyce, always knew you a bitch
But I aint know you got down like that
I hear you issuing threats, you need to kill the jive talk
Furthest thing from street bruh, thats why I call you sidewalk
We here waiting, if you stupid then try it
How you gon knock me out lookin like Snoop on a diet?
Uh, listen slim fast, we all know that
The only time that you raisin up the shooters is in the gym class

Oh man. lets get back into the track

Man, Im so high

I almost forgot to blow the candles out cause I dont really wanna fall asleep and light this house on fire
Goodnight, Im still up, I told my girl to lay down

What up, Bun, my nigga? Man, you know we stay down
And Im a honorary resident in UGK town

Mind on hustlin 
Pussys a commodity but dick sells better
Went from Dickies and house shoes to a cashmere sweater 
Paint done got wetter than it was in nine-fo 
The drank done got thicker and the dirt weed rolled 
Nine-six Impala with the stick on the flo 
Now, its Bentley fo dos with Madrona on the dos 
Thats light wood, nigga , Polo, fuck Hilfiger 
Jammin Slim Thug and belly full of drugs 
Young Hogg nigga , underdog nigga 
Yellow lights on the ground cut through the fog, pussy nigga
Yellow diamonds on my finger, playin in the car 
My dick wanna fuck but my pockets say stop 
Not cause they empty, Im just greedy for some more 
I need some mo dough, Im a P-I-M-P fo sho

Ridin, bangin, get throwed in the candy painted low 
Chrome grille in front of it, belts on the back of it
My chromey shoes runnin shit
Shorty on the side of me is straight up off the King cover 
Dont care what anybody say long as the king love her 
Wish I could tell her that I dont but it would kill her
I just keep on grippin grain , bein trilla
Aint another brother realer, blowin thousand dollar killa
With that Filipino flow that I just got in from Manila
Bout to snow up in my city so let me put on my chinchilla
In the Rari doing donuts like my name was J Dilla 
All about the skrilla so just point me to the dealer
Keep the work up in the attic and the money in the cellar 
Your girl up in the second, automatics for the fellas 
You see us in the back then all you gotta do is tell us
What up? What up?

Yeah, yeah, uh
Im feelin you, guaranteed that you into me
I got the phantom, the aston, the bent-e-ley
But let me tell you where a nigga at mentally
Two things I dont give a bitch: pay checks and sympathy
Ha! But I guess its just the pimp in me
All around paid, cant even get a sentence free
So judge a nigga sweetheart, sentence me
I aint worried its gon happen if its meant to be
And if you ever feel the need to step inside
Be a woman about it and know we living separate lives
Trying to tell you, less feelings mean less goodbyes
Thats some game for your ass, better recognize
But some cats cant even relate
I aint a mind reader though, so if you tryna escape
Then let me know that, show that
My place, roll back, lay down, so flat
Tell Me!
Lyrics from Snippet 2
... Talkin and a lil chit-chat
You rollin with me, then we fucking when we get back
Thats a , tell me if you with that
Dont decline, just recline, sit back

You say you want me, I dont ignore you
You said it first, but I meant it more girl
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
You got potential, I cant explain it
Youre so persuasive, I made some changes
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Where were you this whole time?
Come and see me now, not another time
You should come see me on the regular
I dont know if well find a better time
Where were you this whole time?
Come and see me now, not another time
You should come see me on the regular
I dont know if well find a better time
Cause Ive been sleepin with a pistol in my bed
Id rather have you here instead, I gotta get outta my own head
Dont let me down, come here right now 
Dont let me down, come here right now 
Who the fuck is this paging me a las cinco e la manana?
Y no me habla, me da una rabia
Y depresion, ¿y quien eres tu haciendo conexion?
Recuerdo cuando me pedias no te abandonara
Total todo problema lo arreglamos en la cama
Llegue a la conclusion que si Julieta a mi me ama
No tendria esta pistola debajo de mi almohada
Duerme conmigo, cesa el vacio
Te ha reemplazado en noches de frio
Regresa, amor
Todo conflicto tiene solucion
Duerme conmigo, cesa el vacio
Te ha reemplazado en noches de frio
Es mi pistola la que ahora me acompana
Sustituta en todas las madrugadas
Cause Ive been sleepin with a pistol in my bed
Id rather have you here instead, I gotta get outta my own head
Dont let me down, come here right now 
Dont let me down, come here right now
Grow up and face it, dont keep me waiting
You love me how you love me, then just say it
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Girl, whats the hold-up? Come take me over
You came the closest, we should be closer
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Duerme conmigo, cesa el vacio
Te ha reemplazado en noches de frio
Regresa, amor
Todo conflicto tiene solucion
Duerme conmigo, cesa el vacio
Te ha reemplazado en noches de frio
Es mi pistola la que ahora me acompana
Sustituta en todas las madrugadas
Cause Ive been sleepin with a pistol in my bed
Id rather have you here instead, I gotta get outta my own head
Dont let me down, come here right now 

So hard to breathe this air that we call love 
Aint nothin worse than the hurt we receive from love 
When you get hurt by the one you livin for
Pain can make you wanna love no more
Lovin you no more
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin you no more
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Hurt with the heart thats bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
Im going through hell to convince she love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I’m ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I about to do when her parents do not try
So many tears I cried
But all for nothin I’m afraid to say
Oh
Lovin you no more
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more 
I love you more than I love myself 
Lovin you no more 
I just, I cant, I just can’t be loving you no more 
I love you more than I love myself
I’ve been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is tryin to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life, now its changed
My life, aint the same as you are
Heartbroke to the point sometimes wanna end it
If I can’t have what mean most to me
So many tears I cried 
But all for nothing I’m afraid to say
Oh, oh, oh
Lovin you no more
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more 
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin you no more 
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more 
I love you more than I love myself
Uh, tryin not to over think
Only cause I drove and Ive done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gon do?
Since everything that I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby, then we’d be for sure
So selfishly, you can only show feelings
When you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh, time, oh, time has changed and I’m no longer willing
Cant you see how my heart is bleeding?
I guess I…
Lovin you no more
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more 
I love you more than I love myself 
Lovin you no more 
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more 
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin you no more 
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin you no more
I just, I cant, I just can’t be lovin you no more 

Yeah
Polow da Don
Aye, tell the waitress 
I need a hundred bottles 
 Where the ladies at?
Yeah, a hundred bottles 
Yeah, nah really, a hundred bottles 
Oh, that trip to Miami wasnt nothing 
That was just our first date, baby!
Girl, do whatever you like, its your world
Oh girl, tonight its on me
Baby, tell me what you want
We in the zone, gone off Patron
In the club, in the club, they playing her song
Thats when I slowly approach you, like daddy what you know
Told her girl , then she dropped it down low
To the floor, to the floor, she took it to the floor
To the floor, to the floor, she took it to the floor 
To the floor, to the floor, she took it to the floor 
To the floor, to the floor, she took it to the floor 
Yo, yo, yo

Be your ringtone. I got swissel and cheese but I dont yodel
Heart tatted on my neck they love my vocal

Got me like a stoner, a zoner but nah its never over... 
I stick my tongue out, sipping Remy conceited of Im teasing every bum out
Hung out with celebrities from every drug house
So when you remember me say that I was strung out... 
Im a addict for the green cash Imma O.D. so fuck going to rehab
And Im so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
Im living good gripping wood with all the features
Jesus my money straight no creases
Peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air... we good 
Bitches over there... we good 
Money on the floor we good

T. Slack, I promise I got em, homie!
I turn the phone off, I let the seat back
Imma be out for a minute, Ill bring the heat back
The jet-setta and forever will I get chedda
And yall will only get cash when you get betta
Check luggage, flow to a new city
Plus, the hoodie cover my eyes
Im too pretty, nah, Im just playin
Heavy is how I weigh in
Top floor with a view of the water is what I stay in
But yall dont hear me, yeah, yall aint relatin
Well, let me tell you what happens when I be datin
These chicks with ass fully skip they class
Catch me at the hotel and try and get they cash
But, Im not stupid, nah -- Im tight fisted
You tryna sex me for money is quite twisted
Prior to fall, I was lying to yall
So if you gettin one ring, Im denyin ya call
Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doing his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feeling where hes at let him know
He just doing his thing
Gotta love that
Now my momma kinda iffy, My uncle kinda shifty
Expenses at this point have cost a little over fifty
The hummer and the range was in someone elses name
Hope my citys reputation for the summers gonna change
I hope you stick around and see it
Cause if you aint around Ill bring your chick around to see it
Until she catch feelings and I have to let her go
And when I park my car outside shell stick around and key it
Repercussions of a cheap lash
Had me doing repaints, just to get em re-scratched
And get attached do insane things
Take new jewelry and put it down the drain things
But, thats just the drama that the fame brings
Fresh prince tryna touch sky like
Mr. Busy, Mr. Recieve the shipment
Its Mr. big dreams, no more than 2 months commitment
Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doin his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feelin where hes at let him know
He just doin his thing

Are you familiar with this feeling
No concealing
Its out all out in the open
The type of life you first timers could soak in
That virgin pussys waiting
And Im about to poke it
Im underrated, I am Ricky Henderson to Oakland
But im about to sleep em, Acquire em, and keep em
I require a retainer to retire them and sweep em in a Dust pan
New guy, Too fly, who buy seven cars
Dubai seven stars
You die heavens ours
And you dont see the jag drop in here
Its like im chasing my dad the way I tag pops in in here
Lets see how many carrots we can do
Mixin farm land green with that paratrooper blue
Who are you? You confused homie, thats a pensive look there
Where those are dark oak floors and that expensive cookwear
Thats a 07 but I got a even newer ride
Doors all suicide
I should be your tour guide
Im expedia flown
Wikepidia known
Obtain a key to your home
And take a seat on your throne
I been through it all
Spend it all to do it all
You are not me man I could never be you at all
Cause you just stupid dog
The A8 super large
And yea you got a range but that shit aint even supercharged
Aight check, flow switch, Flow switch
I dont ever pay a percentage of the retail
Only thing Im paying is attention to the detail
Schedule can change at the mention of a email
Booking up a show with some tension with a female
My Dad said to get rich you have to dig deep
Cause Drake these some big streets
And you are not Big Meech
And you are not Rayful
And this is not DC
Four years later quarter million off of TV
You was having hoop dreams
I was drafting group schemes
Take us off of bus kids and turn us into coupe teams
Well woop there it is
Oops now my troops clean
First car Audi drop, Color like a poutine
Im feelin grown up, Dont ask me for id, like you know who I be, bouncer I know the owner
I never go, I felt out of place at a school dance
Cause they know the layout of the mall like I knew france
Inside and out, Therefore I been Hiding out
And you drive cars that I been riding out
Correction I been rode em out
Been showin out, sold off shit the stories youve been told about
And dog, I been old amount
Young money old accounts
Degrassi my royalties
Homie you just owed an once
No weight move
My shoulder counts

Im still fly Im sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
Im still pullin out the phantom and these haters cant stand him
Nigga Im still doin my thing
Im still fly Im sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
Im still shuttin cities down every time I come around
Nigga Im still doin my thing
Im still
Sfera Ebbasta still fly
Vaffanculo a chi mi vuole male
Gia sai cosa fare byebye infame
Con i miei fra dal giorno uno quale rapstar
Il mio culo sulla panca come un pankabbestia
Ma tu mi guardi dal basso ed e inutile che discuti
Talmente in basso che nemmeno se salti lo suchi
Sti babbi stanno muti, si sentono leoni
Ma sono conigli fra non tirano fuori i coglioni
Non ho tempo per le chiacchiere
Ho un bel paio di ali che voglio riuscire a sbattere
Fly baby, finche non tocco piu a terra coi piedi
In alto come i miei diti medi
Voglio svoltare per tirarmi un po fuori dai guai
In stress per il cash che non basta mai
Sfera Ebbasta e tu non riesci a starmi dietro
Per un semplice motivo stronzo Im still fly
Im still fly Im sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
Im still pullin out the phantom and these haters cant stand him
Nigga Im still doin my thing
Im still fly Im sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
Im still shuttin cities down every time I come around
Nigga Im still doin my thing
Im still
E quante volte ti diranno lascia stare baby
Ma non ha senso non lottare per quello in cui credi
Potrei trovare la tipa ideale
Passare la vita a lavorare
E poi morire solo come un cane
Potrei, cambiare il mio modo di ragionare
Iniziare a leccare il culo a tutti
Tanto ormai sembra normale
Non voglio la compassione, coglione
Voglio che ti caghi sotto quando senti il mio nome
Sfera Ebbasta
Troppa gente falsa, mi e girata intorno
E non e mai troppo tardi per rendersene conto
Linvidia fotte il mondo, si sta fottendo te
Io fotto finche ce ne poi ognuno per se
Torno da vincitore caso mai non torno proprio
Sporco come questo gioco
Per raggiungere lo scopo
Al mio fianco questa musica
Lunica, che mi ascolta da ormai troppo tempo
Ma che ancora non mi giudica
Im still fly Im sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
Im still pullin out the phantom and these haters cant stand him
Nigga Im still doin my thing
Im still fly Im sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
Im still shuttin cities down every time I come around
Nigga Im still doin my thing

I dont know how to talk to you
I dont know how to ask you if youre okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
It seems like theyre just happier than us these days
These days I dont know how to talk to you
I dont know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
And last night, I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectation
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
And I just dont understand it
No, Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
And I just dont understand it
I dont know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately, you just make me work too hard for you
You got me on flights overseas, and I still cant get across to you, hmm-hmmm
And last night, I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectation
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
And I just dont understand it
No, Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
And I just dont understand it
Years go by too fast, I cant keep track
How long did we last?
Well, I feel bad for asking
It cant end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
And I just dont understand it
No, Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted

Youre making it feel that everything is alright
Youre my sunflower, youre my sunflower
In a world thats crumbling all around us everyday
You are all the inspiration that I need to find my way
How long Ive been yearning for the day I find my one true love
Now that you are here my darling, I want you to stay 
Youre making it feel that everything is alright
Youre my sunflower, youre my sunflower
Youre making it feel that everything is alright

Whenever you call me, Ill be there with no delay, my love

Any conversation that you want to have, youll have my ear
You can tell me all your secrets, theyll be safe, my dear, oh
Youre making it feel that everything is alright
Youre my sunflower, youre my sunflower
Youre making it feel that everything is alright
Youre my sunflower, youre my sunflower
Im not that good with words, but Im a try my best
Look, I dont wanna ever make you mad, girl
I just wanna have you see you know the things young men are hesitant to have girl
A little you a little me and someone else, good Lord that’s a winner right there
But we really got a story to tell, it can’t finish right there
I used to wonder what my old girl doing right now
Ever since you came into my life
Everytime I think it’d be good to call her
I just think about you and it’d make me think twice, ah yeah
Yeah, I know we’ve been through a couple things
You know a couple things, what are we to do
But you make me feel good, cause you love me for me and you love me for you
Come on
Youre making it feel that everything is alright 
Youre my sunflower, youre my sunflower, hey

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a situation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started caring less and going out more
Dancing your heart out there on the dance floor
Hangin with some girls Ive never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Any time you need to talk
Call me on my cell phone
Any time you need to talk
I know when that hotline bling
I can only say one thing
I know when that hotline bling
I can only say one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just dont get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you dont belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls Ive never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Any time you need to talk
Call me on my cell phone
Any time you need to talk
And I know when that hotline bling
I can only say one thing
I know when that hotline bling

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin up on my old ways

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin up on my old ways
I cant blame you, no

And these haters pretending that its all good
Say that shit in person man, I wish yall would
Im a motherfuckin genius, goddammit
I aint the type to murder you, Im more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really cant stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And dont listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would mean that theres a new me
And if you think Ive changed, then the slightest could have fooled me
Yeah, and to my city Im the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nicknames Starter Drake
Franchise player, I dont even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen, I could draw attention
But you could tell by my strut
Im just chillin in the cut, nigga what, and Im feelin like
I get it, I get it, I get it til Im done
Tell them rappers Im the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin if you plannin on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
Im tryna tell you I do this, but you dont wanna go there homie
Im tryna tell you I do this, but you dont wanna go there homie
Im tryna tell you I do this, but you dont wanna go there homie 
Im tryna tell you do this, but you dont wanna go there homie
Here I go, street reaper
Ballin over here, we need three courts
Violence, you dont wanna resort
The house looks something like a resort
You cant resist bein rich when you record
When this money runs slower than Eeyore
If your life is a movie, you a extra
Im so fly, I glide: Clyde Drexler 
Mister pressure, bitch Im fresher
They must heard that theyll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
Im at the plate right now, fuck next up
I get it, I get it, I get it til Im done
Tell them rappers Im the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin if you plannin on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
Im tryna tell you do this, but you dont wanna go there homie
Im tryna tell you I do this, but you dont wanna go there homie
Im tryna tell you I do this, but you dont wanna go there homie

Mera, dime French, me voa cagar en la madre 
Brr
Los intocable, ¿oite, bebecita?
Ah!
Iced out , no stylist 
New Chanel, Saint Laurent, Gucci bag 
Lifestyle , no stylist 
Louboutin, Jimmy Choo, thats on you ah 
Diamonds on my neck, frozen tears 
Hoppin out the jet, Lears 
Bad bitches gettin wet, here
Yeah, dont call me til the checks clear 
Tre millone en la casa y medio millon en el cuello, yo soy millionario 
No confio en las puta, las puta traicionan, cabron y yo soy bichonario 
Y to el mundo me odia , pero to me maman el bicho, yo soy Donald Trump 
Setenta mil en sortija y cien mil la pulsera, acabe de comprarme un Rolls Royce 
Dosciento mil en muneca y cien mil en la Pateka 
Y ciento...
En New York estoy con SixtyNine y como con trescientos cabrones 
Y tenemo un R y tenemo otro R con los de cien y los tambore
Y si me matan manana, me voy a morir con como trentiocho melone, brr! 

I dont know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still cant get across to you
Look...I dont know how to talk to you
I dont know how to ask you if youre okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like theyre just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I dont know how to talk to you
I dont know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
I dont know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still cant get across to you
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it

My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like theyre just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I dont know how to talk to you
I dont know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
I dont know how to talk to you

Got me on flights overseas, and I still cant get across to you

And I know what youre thinking, but... no
You can not move in with me if Trump wins
Im sorry, thats no go
I really am glad to be here but youll ha...youll have to excuse me if I seem a little upset
Backstage, right before I came out
My friend showed me this...meme he found online
And it just...it really shook me
It was a picture of me dancing in my Hotline Bling video
And some joker...had put a caption on it that said
When you farted and got away with it
And if Im being real, like...it hurts, you know...and it...
It just seems like this keeps happening to me
And I dont know...Its almost like I can do is sing about it
So...Im ready
Drinks with some old friends
Thats when it happens again
I start hearing from the whole fam
That I got clowned on Instagram
Tryna hide my reaction
When I read the funny caption
Feels like Im in a bad dream
Cause I got turned into another meme, yeah
I just wanna scream
That Im more than a meme, thats right
I just wanna scream
That Im more than a meme
Catch me looking with those bedroom eyes
Asking if youre gonna finish those fries
Tryna say you really care about me
But then you put my picture on E.T 
How can I explain to my momma
When you got my beard on Obama
I do not complain, I am not a whiner
But why am I sitting on the Seinfeld diner?
I feel like Im swimming upstream
Against all of these memes
Why do they attack me?
And then attack my favorite team?
Look, Im not just a picture, I have feelings too
Like, how would you feel if it happened to you?
If I came after you, did a meme of her
Yeah cause your sketch got cut after dress rehearsal 
What if I found your moment of pain
And used it for my own comedy gain?
Now you know what I mean
That Im more than a meme
And look, I get that my face is expressive
But some of the memes are a little aggressive
I would just say its a little excessive
When you go make me the face of Progressive
I know its not important
But when they catch my face contorted
And the meaning gets distorted
I can only help but feel like crying Jordan
Im more than a meme
Oh, ladies and gentleman, do I have a treat for you tonight
Rihanna is here tonight, make some noise
Oh Im so excited to be here tonight
Oh my God, oh my God
Yeah, see Drake aint a meme, meme, meme, meme, meme
But it nah seem, seem, seem, seem, seem, seem
Another joker getting, getting, getting, getting, getting
I swear we only friend, friend, friend, friend, friends...
Alright, Rihannas incredible ladies and gentleman
Make some noise for her please

It feels like Im the victim of an internet scheme

Through the vast enchanted forest
The surrounding skies are one
Torn apart by the phenomenon of lightning
Rain is pouring down my shivering shoulders
In the rain my tears are forever lost
The darkened oaks are my only shelter
Red leaves are blown by the wind
An ebony raven now catches my eye
Sitting in calmness
Before spreading his black wings
Reaching for the skies
In this forest
Where wolves cry their agony unto the moon
My spirit is hidden
In the form of wisdom
Carved on a black stone
The only way to follow
Open your soul
Redeem, I am immortal
Blinded by a light
My soul is held up in glory
I engulf the skies
The apostle in triumph
Through the eternal flame I travel

I wake up, assessin the damages
Checkin MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin out with a bitch
But its blurry enough to get out of that shit...
...But I still drove thirty hours to you
Yeah, yeah
I remember rappin for Jay an Cam
Young producer just tryin to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victorias Secret
Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
...
You call down for an omelet, girl, its 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria

K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac
All that bullshits for the birds, you aint nothing but a vulture 
Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
Youll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah

Say bye bye, say bye bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
According to my old bish, I be on some new ish
She was on some oldish, now I got a new bish

Drizzy voice
Now Im ghost, baby, four-door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice

Oh, you talkin, what about?

No more tryna make it work 
You made me wanna say bye bye

The farewell email from a female 
But Im a playa, aint gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin seashells
By the seashore, but shes not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you cant ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store
And leave with all them shopping bags and half of it aint yours
I did things for her, aint rich, aint poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just aint know her
Well enough to know if this was all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited, she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody thats a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
Its hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know its juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin up excuses
Chase Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin sad songs
Im on some new shit
Im chucking my deuces up to her 
Im moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye bye

No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for Trinity Chris word
See my role models roll with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough than the whole lotto

What up Nikko, Jordan, Lucky and TJ nicknamed the Night Fox clique we take it easy

Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep

Pay attention, its the beginnin of a new era 
Get a little closer you can see the view clearer 
Its like Lasik but are basic
Ebonics if youre hooked on chronic and you can taste it
Trace it, recognize the real when ya face it
Ball up in the club gettin white boy wasted
One shot of Patron, then another one to chase it
Put me to the test, I wont pass it Ill ace it

From Shreveport down to New Orleans 
And all points in between just to get the cream 
Me and my II Trill team on the road flippin 
Eight hours straight, no stops, no trippin 
Had to keep them heaters on em so its no slippin 
Promote a play with show money, we were slow grippin 
Sometimes we rock the stage and put it down 
Other times we had to fight and shoot it out of town 
But we always made it home okay
And we still on the road to this day
I gotta say its been a pleasure
Emotions in this game run deep

Id like to say its been a pleasure
Reppin til my last second through
Done a lot of shit theyll never get to do
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin attention
Ill just say its been a pleasure
Youll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow aint guaranteed, so tonight we gon do it like this
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight Im gon make some money go
For the H-Town
They say that you never really know
What you got til its gone and cant touch it 
If it look too good to be true, you cant trust it 
If you never had it then you can never miss it 
But looks can be deceivin, so dont you get it twisted 
Walked a lot of miles in these old school Js 
Thought of many ways, lookin at back in the days 
Like how to climb from in between a rock, and a hard place
How to keep your cool when youre dealin with a hard case 
And how to duck, when the judge throw the book at you 
And its a two-sided mirror that youre lookin through 
The phone receivers in your hand starin at your child 
And your heart skips a beat every time they smile 
See thats how real life is and how it can be 
And how its deeper then just comin down candy 
So Im just tryin to play the cards that they hand me
For those that overstood me, understand me
Its been a pleasure
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Reppin til my last second through
Done a lot of shit theyll never get to do
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin attention
Ill just say its been a pleasure
Youll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow aint guaranteed, so tonight we gon do it like this
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight Im gon make some money go
For the H-Town
Id like to say its been a pleasure

I know youve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, heres what Ill do
Ill take care of you
Ive loved and Ive lost
Ive asked about you and theyve told me things
But my mind didnt change and I still feel the same
Whats a life with no fun? Please, dont be so ashamed
Ive had mine, youve had yours, we both know... we know
They wont get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you cant sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste
Ah, pushing me away so I give her space
Ah, dealing with a heart that I didnt break
I be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just dont know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just dont show
When youre ready, just say youre ready
When all the baggage just aint as heavy
And the partys over, just dont forget me
Well change the pace and well just go slow
You wont ever have to worry, you wont ever have to hide
Youve seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes
I know youve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, heres what Ill do
Ill take care of you
Ive loved and Ive lost
Its my birthday, Ill get high if I want to
Cant deny that I want you but Ill lie if I have to
Cause you dont say you love me to your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do... you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that youre following your heart
Cause your mind dont control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, dont be so ashamed
Ive had mine, youve had yours, we both know... we know
You hate being alone well you aint the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody shouldve told you some
To save you.. instead they say:
Dont tell me, I dont care
If you hurt, I dont tell you
You dont care, if youre true
Slow...
Take it slow...
Take it slow...

-girl, you know me
Still with the dawgs that I grew beside

Way before we had these fuckin fancy ass fuckin LED lights and shit

The only thing we had- the only thing we had was classic shit like this
Hey!

I had this little bad thing, somethin like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin with her is
Is the chick aint even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where weve come and how we still have to go really far
Like, Baby, look at how we live broke on Bragg boulevard
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin we get knowin that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin
You feelin when you be drillin that shit
Got her sayin you be killin that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin that shit
And naw, that aint your girl, dog
But you be feelin that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime its lights, please
Lights please, lights please
Sing!
Turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
Im feeling like things gon be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
Im feeling like things gon be alright
Ah shit

Smokin weed on the beach as my mind workin like- Hands up!
Analyzin the world, fantasizin bout girls

Sweatin her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck Im doin in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute

They killin niggas for Js, thats death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over Dwana

Helpless, melting in her presence, I am selfish she can tell this
She can tell me anything; Ill buy it if she sells it
Told me her name is heaven, but shes hotter than hell is
Love locked down; Ill be your felon
Wait.. she love to get her pussy ate like Ellen
One two, you can come she can come too
You gon cum, she gon cum too
Pass out, & do it all again when we come to
We can kick it like a shoe.. KungFu
She make it stop, pop like the drum do
These bitches typical, you show me sumthin new
I tell her, I tell her:
We not just any guys
I bet they broke for a reason, no need to empathize
I tell patron truths, i tell you henny lies
And you believeem all; I can see it in your eyes
I take you down like 
Me without no money, that dont sound right 
I could put you on this side of town flight
And even have a driver pick you up girl, what that sound like 
I guess big big money, all this money
I dont even know what to call this honey
Takes so long just to get to the point where youre rich and youre there and its all so funny
I stunt so they can see me, & therefore they should know
They call me Drizzy baby, wanna see you make it go
She can make it go
Bring it high, bring it down, take it low, then make it go
She can make it go; start off going fast but then she take it slow, take it slow
She can make it..
She make it & it sound like 
She make it, & it sound like 
She make it, & it sound like 
She make it, & it sound like: 

You know that people gon change
Feelings they all seem to fade
Lovers they all drift away
And become so damn estranged
Friends flip they turn into foes
But humble and quiet no more
Even as life seems to fade
Im still alive, Im on a wave
Im on a ride, Im everywhere
Im hard to find, dont need a man
Aint got the time, busy as fuck
You know whats up, stay on my grind
But I still play, these niggas hearts

Just thinkin of, me n mine, me n mine
You finally start to care

Youre ready for something new

Seems like youre wantin to stay
But you need to know

Im everywhere/Im hard to find 
Dont want a man/Im just a guy/ youre just a guy
Busy as fuck 
You know whats up 
And I got a life now

Still pay a car note for this girl around my way 
Yeah 11x
Friends flip
They turn into foes
But humble and quiet no more
Even as life seems to fade
Im still alive/Im on a wave
Im on a ride/Im everywhere
Im hard to find/Dont need a man
Aint got the time/Busy as fuck
You know whats up/Stay on my grind
But I still play/These niggas hearts
I never stay /Im out of love
Just thinkin of /Me n mine, me n mine

Her days are over
Baby, shes over

Red lipstick on a wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you want it fast? Define fast
Cause I could speed it up and make it last
And I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed
Hit em all, switch it up
Put em on, zip it up
Let my perfume soak into your sweater

No option for her, you sayin no

Follow my lead, whatchu waitin for?

Plus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you, bang
The baddest woman ever and the hardest out
Proven over and over again, thats why Im hard to doubt
Plus Im Young Money to the death, I took the Carter route
Im more than ready, too
Hope its somethin that you thought about
Nothin on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if youd be able to handle me
Mental pictures, no cameras please
Can you feel, my heart is beating
Can you feel, my heart is beating
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over
Baby, shes over

And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings 
Im still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters cant stand em 
Nigga, Im still doing my thing 
Im still fly, Im sky high 
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings 
Im still shuttin cities down every time I come around 
Nigga, Im still doing my thing 
Im still
Responsible for everything you listen to, a mediocre talent, let me see if I can condition you
Took over my city, and I never asked permission to
Started poppin bottles, cause its ATL tradition to
Celebrate with Bob Ma, fuck him at the So-ho
If there aint an elevator in it, its a no go
Coldest thing droppin, and these bitches wanna snow blow
And they just give me head, while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ shouldve won that
Listen and respect, man, the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, halla at me when youre done laps
Roll around with Neego, Party with Azooka
Shout goes out to 1Da, shout goes out to Future
Shout goes out to Getti, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch, just cant seem to hold it steady
Cause I see the flame flickering, x girls bickering
Got these women jockin me from Holly Grove all the way to Picker Ring
I tryed to send my nigga Short some syrup out in Michigan, but my connect said itd take a minute if you listening
Please start doing you, I been doing me
And Im a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin me
But I got love for everybody, even if you suin me
My brother P-rain know, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot an officer in plain clothes
Starin at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hopin on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just halla if you got me, fuck you if you had me
Shout goes out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver, and 40, man, you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to B Plus
The names I mention are crucial, you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine
I am so sure of my rhymes, I could sacrifice a line
Yeah, I swear, I really fuckin does it
I had these niggas trippin, no luggage
Im still fly, Im sky high
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
Im still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters cant stand em
Nigga, Im still doing my thing
Im still fly, Im sky high 
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
Im still shuttin cities down every time I come around
Nigga, Im still doing my thing

From Zone Six to the SWATS, Im a keep the block burnin
Long as the world keep turnin, money Im gon be earnin 
Lost my train of thought, if someone find it, return it
You niggas wanna beat me like my children, Im hearin 
You come between my paper route, thats pass interference
Now cash interference, I shine just like my earrings 
Its $50 K today, twelve bars, a feature appearance
My sneaker bill cost more than what you make in a year, man
Dont near man, theres no one near man, youre like a cheer man
No coachin, Gucci the GM and youre the beer man
Dont try me like Im a pussy another tin man
I rap I bust bricks so you can call it R&B man
Gucci!
I got a new side job, Im hip-hop security
And what that means is Im takin all credentials
What you say and what you do, accomplishments, accolades
Im like the airport, all identification will be checked
Drama!
Look, uh, feelin sorry for the runner up
Im still away gettin money when the sun is up
And they keep sayin how they need me to deliver
Cause they hate it when the rookie starters cant put the numbers up
Maann, hate is so pase, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day, nigga
And its just me and my money, yall dont even get to play when yall are leading by twenty
Yeah, I infiltrated the game, I was hesitant at first and feared what it would change
Now Im high of the success and faded off of the fame
But still I managed to keep all of my opinions the same
Man, I am So Far Gone, bitch Im outta here
Hotter than santa inside rockin nauta wear
I want it all man, I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires
Wow, I swear Im killin shit, Im killin shit
Shoutout to the niggas I just made a couple million with
Yeah, from the beginning to the end
Know Im into making history, not into making friends, motherfuckaa
Ive seen a lot come and go
Some niggas was runnin too fast, ran outta breath too quick
Us over here? We pace ourselves, the finish line is way far ahead
You niggas keep gettin cramps in the race, dont pass out, baby!
Look for me in the rafters!
Mike bigga baby, its bigger baby, Gucci, Louis, Prada
Don Dada, I am hot as the Sahara
What I spit in my saliva is a flow hotter than lava
When I grab a microphone, I flame on like Waka Flocka
Got a thirty-eight revolver that I call my problem-solver
I aint worried bout no rappers, they just talk, they just holler
When that fire hit their ass, theyll walk, they crew will follow
Like a pimp, I pop my collar, at the prospect of tomorrow
Naw said life a bitch, so Im a break her for some dollars
I will never be a simple, sorry, sucka stuck in squalor
I will murder ever verse I ever versed to get the guala
I am cursed since I first dispersed a dime bag of rocka in exchange for a dollar
Ay, to all you other rappers out there
If Im not eatin with ya, and you have an opinion about me
Always remember how insignificant your opinion is to the world
Whether you like, or dislike me, tomorrows coming

Cups of the rose
Bitches in his old phone

He needs you right now, are you down to listen to him?
Too many drinks have been given to him
Hes got some women thats livin off him

He bets that you know them, he wont say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
Hes had sex four times this week; Hell explain

‘Cause if they did, they gonna be in some trouble

Uh

Its 10 oclock on a Wednesday and I know youre home
Driving up and down our street hoping that youd come outside
Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me oohhhh
Childish as it seems it will make it all better, better
Selfish as it is this aint just about you noooooo
Did me wrong every time we were together, gether

Somehow I feel like you cheated me
I just wanted someone to believe in me
But you werent there, you werent there
You couldnt even make it to my first show
Thats why Im putting in this fucking work though
Im becoming everything that I told you Id be
Ive been living like a bachelor no bachelor degree
I feel like the shit has ran its course
I guess I never needed your support
Now let me hop out the motherfucking Porsche

I just really need the right of way
So that I can lane switch
Trust anybody that I came with
They will be here when I aint rich
I-I-I swear, I know, they are in the boat I row
E’rrybody in it gotta paddle, muthaf-cker won’t let go
I done made a hundred thousand dollars every season I was on that show
I’ve been told I was next by a legendary that was on Death Row
It’s a secret, I’ma tell ‘em, rappers only claiming they get paid
I’ve been gettin love in the club ever since a nigga came in underage
I just put Patron in the pineapple and I do the same with lemonade
Let my money flow through the air, I can make it rain on your parade
I can do it, I can do it and I know the rumours get around
I’ma take my city to the top and then I’ma never let ‘em down
I’ma show a lot of people love, I’ma give ‘em credit where it’s due
Anyone that got it I can do it, this the one I dedicate to you
I’m gon do what I want
Cause this life’s made for living
You got to know nothings for sure
Faith in the stars
I’m gon do what I want
Cause this life’s what I’m given
Gotta keep my faith in the dark clouds
Cardiac arrest rap tag
Wait a sec, wait a minute, I’ve been in it from beginning
Spinnin’ raps like my heart was a tape deck, yes
I’ve been on the block, freestyling, wylin’ while I was a yout’
Many wonder what the truth it, when the future’s like a tattoo
Gotta make haste while the sun shines
If you only live one time when the spaceships arrive from the skies
I’ll be flyin’, I’m not lyin’ I’m sublime in my alpah state
Let the heart palpitate
Let the soul just astroplane
Here’s a secret, let me tell ‘em
We’re the ones that started rock n roll
Jimi Hendrix, Little Richard, platform shoes and an afro comb
Me ET phone home, BET play my song
Had faith oh so long, thats why we both flowed on so
Ohhhhh, I’m like another message they sent on the bottle
Now people knooooooow…
’bout a freak of nature with a pen and paper
Can’t escape in the ether if you got faith, yeah
See that

You took my heart and my dreams and my patience

I never commented on Yeezus for my interview portion of Rolling Stone. They also took my cover from me last minute and ran the issue
Im disgusted with that. RIP to Phillip Seymour Hoffman. All respect due. But the press is evil

Sometimes I need you

Then we can do the damn thing
Tryna put the pressure on me
Im gonna leave it up to faith
I know you want an answer
But you got to, got to, got to, got to wait
Sweetie I hope youre takin the lines down
Shake it and wine round
Twist up to this one

Its new and improved, no mistakin from afar
You just do what you do and Ill be waitin in the car
Aw you can twist it up , and you can let it flow 
You can pull it back or leave it and let it grow 
Braid it and put it under fleece in the winter
Just never slang it back with the piece in the center
Dudes be like, Baby, boo lets go

Cause I reside up north and aint forcin a U.S. flow
You heard?

While I twist my hair
Im gonna twist my hair
Later on Ill let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear
If its more than I can bear, baby
Im just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
See I like my independence
But right now, listen
Later on Ill let you know if this love

While I twist my hair
Or do I need to be single?
Ooh baby, baby

Yeah, dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
Told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your familys house, for what?
Said you need some time, but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin rounds the same as being stuck
And like guns with the ink in, youre gettin under my skin
Pretty little young thing
Had a honey convinced, got me too excited
You played me, you played me, you played me
Lowdown, dirty, shameful, crazy

How you even managin to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately?
Lord knows you still look amazin
Thats besides the point Im makin

To have to force it or have to fake it
Yes, Im hurting, yes, Im jaded 
Most of these things I dont wanna say 
I wanna be around while you chasin 
You wanna hit me up when you make it
Youll try and come back when you famous

A scrub is a guy thinks thinks hes fly

A scrub is a guy who cant get no love from me
Hangin out the passenger side of his best friends ride
Tryin to holler at me

A scrub is a guy who cant get no love from me
Hangin out the passenger side of his best friends ride
Tryin to holler at me

Caught up in a popularity contest

Haters talk it like my buzz isnt enough promotion

Have confused all the conversations between yall
And dog thats funny, pay me what owe me nigga
All cash money

Cigar full of kush, you need prescriptions to access
Laying on a mattress, with your favourite actress
My flow is going out, I said baby pass the matches
And let her top me off while Im tapping off the ashes
Classy but classless, you danced off the guest-list
A lady here but said it, nigga get past it
Take it what youve got, you shouldve passed it
You was moving slower than molasses, its time you were nasty
Give it up too, its a jack, dont move
This is murder music, nigga dont disturb this groove
Too trill with the team, Cash Money ?

All summer sixteen

Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge
To do what you couldnt do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kais kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try to say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those the strings that you can’t pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house

Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen

Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge
All you boys doing fake Controllas wanna be me a little
All your exes know I like my O’s with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave you the whole money play and yall still broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, Now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mines just biggers what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here
I’m not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne

Yeah, so trust me, they’ll be out here…
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen

I dont know how to talk to you
I dont know how to ask you if youre okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like theyre just happier than us these days, yeah
These days, I dont know how to talk to you
I dont know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently, yeah
And last night, I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it, I hope you can take it
Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just dont understand it
No, Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just dont understand it
I dont know how to talk to you, yeah
I just know I found myself getting lost with you, yeah
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still cant get across to you, yeah
And last night, I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it, I hope you can take it
Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just dont understand it
No, Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted 
I just dont understand it
Tell the UK tings that I soon forward

I might just, I might just
Buy since Richview
Dreamin of the places I can get to
Drizzle, all the mandem miss you
Man like that need a visa to get you, baow
But, girl, listen
I wanna do the things that I mentioned
I wanna benefit from this friendship
I wanna get the late-night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I
Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just dont understand it
No, Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted

They said I wasn’t gon show up, that’s what the real talk was about
Well I showed up with Showwoutt and you know he show out, i have him beatcha till ya blood fly all in the crowd all of the crowd
My city a real life jungle, I ain’t ever shook at night
I seen them Raptors up close before they booked my flight
What you 85 pounds? Ha ha ha … I mean you look that light
I could drop you off a jab, so imagine if I hook that right
I got killers running back in the field, no Forte
Respected everywhere from St. Louis to Norway
Slam yo ass right on stage, make the floor shake
Ain’t nobody leaving, Show, cover the doorway
Nina, menage a trios, fuck what his whore say
The deuce deuce give em a kiss, that’s foreplay 
I match that Glock with a Fif, that’s how I throwaway
I snap and toss Shotty out that window like a throwaway
Y’all gon fuck around and get this sweet boy shot
You cross this line I shoot the tre, no 3 point shot
Double meaning, you cross the line there’s no 3 point shot
But when I say I shoot the tre-
Who’s supposed to be the champ up north? Pat Stay?
Man look ... I’ll lyrically smack Stay
Switch moves, turn around, smack Stay
Chop em up, they find his body where Smack stay
No joking I’ll really get at Stay
Like “Man what the fuck you smoking? Crack, Stay?”
My nickname Freddy with this Kruger I clutch
My baby momma left me, she said I sleep with the Ruger too much
And you know that bitch loaded, this Ruger from Lux
A Smith & Wes’ and a Taurus, this a Ruger Deluxe
This battle mean nothing my nigga, I’m a fuckin vet
So take this personal, you’re just a fuckin check
Drake let me get something straight, I’m up-fucking-set
Y’all through me in a dunk contest with a nigga who can’t touch the net?
I was at the airport with just 30 shots, that just mean more can get it
I’m a king so they ain’t check us 
How you think I flew across border with it?
I jumped off the plane hungry, like where my body at?
They offered me some food, I’m like “Cool, where Shotty at?”
You had a classic with a nigga I killed? You know I body cats
Battle after battle, I stretch em out, Pilate cats
It’s more than a Shmurda when I pull out this Bobby black
 Man gimme my shotty back
Toronto front page, Hitman blew Shotty back
It’s gon be more than a Shmurda when I pull out this Bobby black
 Nigga gimme my shotty back
 Nigga gimme my shotty back
 Nigga gimme my shotty back
Toronto front page, Hitman blew Shotty back
(Shotty testing the mic)
Yall want some real shit now?
Yall want some real shit now?
Some said I wasn’t gon show up, but that’s what the talking’s about
But I show up to the showdown to show off when the show’s on
For all of the crowd, so it’s showtime
So it’s Showtime in the words of Verb cuz that’s your idol
You a showman, you showing up with Showwoutt to the big show
But I Paul White ya that’s, chokeslam him during his remix
If show starts I got show stopper with a super kick that’s Shawn Michaels
Plus I got a sharp shooter in Montreal
That’ll finish Hitman like Shawn Michaels
Ill let you know know I got respect for Show
Cuz he reps his bro that’s Hitman’s brother
It’s no secret still, when he had that beef with Bill
Who did they hit? Man’s brother
But today I showed up with something for him
That can deflect and hit man’s brother
For a win you can die in the ring like Hitman’s brother
You know Owen/a win, dead in the ring let JR talk to em
If you think Jerry the King, remix that
Where I’m from we cut war and remix that
Don’t take man for no kind of Charron out here, keep it rap
Cuz we know this bitch ain’t down with Action like Azealia Banks
Oh here we go
Oh here we go, 3 rounds alike of basketball is what you gonna do
No bars, just remixes and dance routines as substitute
Try me without all that shit, some of that he couldn’t do
You’ll need your brother to help you catch the body like the Dudleys move
I got space in that graveyard and you just made a grave mistake
Keep talking shit, you’ll all get lit
They’ll be mourning/morning Hit like a wake and bake
Little Gerald, Little Gerald...
Little Gerald, Gerald it’s time to talk
When that show’s over the long nose will show us Jerry’s Final Thoughts
Oh you brought ya crew to do me dirty well derrty don’t get me pissed off
Therell be a Sermon Ill Parish when that shit splits hits squad 
Talking bout “re-reload the bullet that came out em” dumb clown
Or maybe that’s your way of admitting you only ever have one round
King Of Performance? On what ground?
You can do that Billie Jean bullshit on Smack but not now
We’re the wrong crowd
See you deliver ... your rhymes ... real slow
And you can stretch a minute into two with that
Ganik are you stupid this is versus Supernat
I don’t know what to do with that
Could’ve done this in Missouri
Handmade zip cuz, even in the Lou he bags
Well he’ll try me, but if he dare we on his face like the Gucci tat
Aye, KOTD, Blackout I ain’t come to mess around
Shotty knock his bredrin down
You disloyal piece of- … oooohhhh, I’ll save that for the second round
Man first off I took a $10,000 pay cut just to take this battle
And I still made $10,000 more than you make per battle
You see this big boy talk, he don’t like it, it get him hella tight
Man, you ain’t worth my presence
If it wasn’t for these fans I would’ve battled you via satellite
Check my background, I’m not a nigga to play with
I spray quick, big Mossberg, give em a facelift
I’m Caesar, I give a sign and my niggas will swing through on some ape shit
You beefing? You beefin? I’ma hit you where it hurt like who you lay with
In other words I’m just gon fuck ya bitch on some Drake shit
Then send it to Worldstar on some “I ain’t know it was taped” shit
Just so y’all can see what the bitch left on her face with
All that slick talk, watch ya mouth, I’m saying
One shot will hit and flip you out ya van
This ya dog? Man I’ll beat the Shih Tzu out ya man
Then pistol whip the pistol out ya hand
Man fuck everybody until my mama through with cancer
I might show up to ya show just to shoot a dancer
Who you fooling like you fighting and you move with hammers?
Boy you wouldn’t raise ya hand if you knew the answer
In this battle rap world I’m in, fuck being humble
Heavyweight, view by view, I do the sickest number
Five punch combo connect, man that’s vicious thunder
Straight left, lift em up, uppercut, flip em under
I get the swinging like I’m trying to break Griffey numbers
Man I’ll beat you to the white meat and say I told you so
Ya bitch gon date a crackhead like that Khloe hoe
With that Desert Eagle, I turn into the Mamba, the Kobe show
I hope you know, I put that bird on ya chest like OVO
They call me every day like “Hitman yall looting”
Rest In Peace Mike Brown
But white boy I was still pissed about the Trayvon shootin
So I’m masked up, looking like a Raekwon movement
Me and my dogs will get to hunting like the K9 unit
What? Since he’s a skinhead that acts out of control
I’m supposed to believe what he rapping y’all?
You from Manchester
The only wild cats we know in the UK play basketball
You, it’s nothing you could do with me boy cuz my clips larger
If Show swing, you’ll land in the crowd, that’s the shit starter
If I swing you’ll land by the bar, cuz I hit harder
Toronto ain’t seen a better 1-2 punch since T-Mac and Vince Carter
Yo, am I good?
They told me I got Holla, that’s when my bad mood started
They ordered a Hitman for the Hitman, I just acquired that new target
Load em up, I brought a strap to blast through Shamu’s carcass
When I draw I wipe blood from the picture like a tattoo artist
I’m a baboon snapped in a bamboo bag
With my bare hands to stab through hearts
Started at grassroots and had that American glass roof parted
They want bars! not this brand new tap shoe dance move garbage
I’m the new wave and you really can’t surface after that Tsunami
You got washed by Surf, then got a white boy, boy that’s too gnarly
Try me, I’m on ya crib with a can like you have roof parties
You need Dutch courage to 
I will let that Pac Juice charge me
You was quiet til that Remy came out, I’ll put you in that Papoose margin
Like I said, KOTD, Blackout, I ain’t come to mess around
Taste ya medicine, I’ma do a lil bit of exposing in the 2nd round
Cuz I know why you’re here Gerry
Can we talk about the beef with Smack?
You when you jumped on Twitter swearing on ya team and flag
That if you see em it’s gon be at least a scrap
But what did he do to deserve any piece of that?
Did he fuck ya bitch? No? D-Did he steal a stack? No…
Oh, he took too long to release the Conceited match
You cheeky twat! How dare you repeatedly bite the hand
That helps feed ya fam
When he was the owner of the only league that let you compete for cash
That man took you from a dirty piece of shit
To a featured brand with a sea of fans
I’m talking before your hairline receded back
And had a teeny chance of making an NBA season draft
He’s the reason you can afford them red leather sequinned pants
And Showwoutt’s fee to do a remix dance
Talking about
Talking about where’s Norbes, Cheeko, and Beasley at
You need appeasing and someone needs to see to that
Shut the fuck up! Miss us with that diva act
The damn truth is youre Frank Lucas
We wouldn’t know you exist if it wouldn’t have been for Smack, but...
You, you said if they release Arsonal first, it’s on the flag and rep of ya people
Well, they did that and you did nothing, so that was very deceitful
When you said you was gonna shoot on blood
Lil Gerald that never will be
If he shoots on B’s then that’s Resident Evil
Me and Arsonal did 6 million, you must act like I ain’t contributed to the hits
Well you and Arsonal did half them numbers in twice the time
If you don’t understand that then you stupid as shit
That means there was a 100% increase when they added me
And removed you from the mix
3 Million … Drake I can’t see him with these Views From The 6
Thats my second round in 
Man I put niggas to sleep, automatic or handguns
Everybody I clap throws off, Conceited slow that down
Automatic or handguns, everybody I clap dose off
They sent them contracts, I’m like yeah, it’s grind time
But to keep it real I was ready before I signed mine
They told me, switch up and joke, nah that’s Grindtime
I’m more of the “you’ll get choked” a ticking time bomb
A football star, you can ask, I was Moss like
Could switch to that mask and ratchet, the lacrosse type
And if I get mad, I spaz like
“I need everything he made back, I’m the rawest type”
I’m coming for the belt, who got it? Tell em he’s next
The K Shine, it ain’t nothing but Murda, ask T-Rex
When I look at Shotty, naw, I don’t see threat
You was supposed to battle Verb and Ill, and I’m ya final destination?
You see all that prove is you can’t cheat death
I got a Navy Seal connect, man this shit loud
The weapon he just plug me with about his size
It’s war, you run with ya squad, you never switch rides
You get sliced down the middle for not picking sides
They got me back on that wild shit
Knock, knock, knock, who is it? Kidnap his child shit
Pow pow shit, that 40 or that Cal shit
Shotty watch ya mouth, I’m not the one to get loud with
That shit I just did, that’s an effortless move
You Golddust looking motherfucker, you just put me in a wrestling mood
If I decide to bomb first, best believe Ima land mine
I ain’t scared of no nigga, that boy was from Mankind
Three 2 minute rounds for what? That’s the long road
I could’ve beat you with 3:16’s that’s Stone Cold
A million views every battle is easy, that’s a simple trait
That’s why I’m Hitman “Hollywood” Holla, that’s Triple H
Where I’m from niggas get clapped up in the lobby
The army has been instructed to catch bodies
The officers killing my race like it’s a hobby
In other words ain’t shit horror about Shotty
For 25K Mook could kill a nigga that’s ill
Man for that 10k I’ll kill this nigga for real
You came to talk about balls, and that shit’s so gay
The console its sold separately, meaning I ain’t with those games
You trying to bring back the old Holla
You need more than tank tops and big rope chains
You need the fire and skill plus the desire and will
And a sponsorship with Rogaine
I’d a killed you when you were ya lil bros age
For the record I’d a MOP’d that Billy dance for a lil Fame
MOP, Billy Danze, Lil Fame, switch the lane
Spill his brains, when that Shotty’s in his face, this shit’s Cobain
I’d shoot the hair off Holla’s head, trust I got that killer aim
Two hands steady the beam, they support the dot like Drizzy Drake
What’s real to you? Basketball or a gangbanger? Pick that shit
Ain’t no such thing as half way crooks Gerry, and you ain’t with that shit
Split personalities, persona disorder, you see how quick man flip
Aye let’s just say it’s JFK, there’s still questions about who that Hitman is
But I have a question, and I hope you have the answer to it
If battle rap’s a cappella why you always dancing to it
Fuck bars, you and Aye Verb spend your time
Trying to plan the coolest hand maneuvers
You almost did a YMCA just to tell me about a strap you’re using
Fuck you think this is? Fuck you think this is, though?
Fuck you think this is? I ain’t playing Hitman game
Now bald headed white boy shoots and
Everyone’s in black suits like the Hitman game
URL King Of Performance, uhhh let me throw the debate in
I think Roc took ya spot like Coke in the 80’s
I’m in the Dot again
I’m in the Dot again
Deep Waters just passed me the strap in case I actually need it
So if I have to act like an idiot it’d be more clapping and screaming
Then you and Showwoutt after a remix
It’s Horroh, It’s Horroh, the one that brought a Tom in Gerry’s house
To put holes in every wall like Tom & Jerry’s house
But his chick saw em, she let me knock out on the couch
I ain’t rob her, but she still had the Shotty in her mouth
Your chick loves that hard white, not the coco
But tonight I will be over your bird like the sponsors logo
What? I will be over your bird...
Im meant to believe the plasticine gangster theme?
Im meant to believe you’re in the banda with a strap in each hand as you’re trapping keys?
Rapper please, you’ll be shook in the suburbs
Probably get robbed by a gang of geeks
I mean he walk in a white hood and stay quiet, well that’s Assassins Creed
What’s big money to small change? Two words after this

Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever its worth, I give whatever Im worth
For my niggas who gon go to Hell and back for me
Ima give em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, thats lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like its a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasnt luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you dog
That shit get-get petty, bitch, dont give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now its back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This aint what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why Im your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I dont know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God
Im here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I havent had a good time in a long time, you know I
Im way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed 
Im way up, I feel blessed 
Way up, I feel blessed
Look, I aint gon say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that were back from something
If were back from somethin theres some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I dont need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, Im doing a toast
For niggas that dont really do shit, I swear, yall be doing the most
Stop worrying bout whoevers next
I am just worried bout my mama worrying less
I think Im famous enough, I dont need any more press
I am convinced Im the only one left
Thats still doing this shit, man
Im here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I havent had a good time in a long time, you know I
Im way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed 
Im way up, I feel blessed 
Way up, I feel blessed
My grandma just died, Im the man of the house
So every morning Im up ‘cause I cant let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So Im going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, Im that invested, but you cant attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know thats a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, its only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together?
Im here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I havent had a good time in a long time, you know I
Im way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed 
Im way up, I feel blessed

Its impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and law enforcement remains as strained as it did decades ago. No one begins their life as a hashtag. Yet the trend of being reduced to one continues.
This is real and Im concerned. Concerned for the safety of my family, my friends, and any human being that could fall victim to this pattern. I do not know the answer. But I believe things can change for the better. Open and honest dialogue is the first step.
My thoughts and prayers are with the Sterling family and any family that has lost someone to this cycle of violence.

Every night its all the same
Poppin bottles for them bitches, gettin faded
Im happy you noticed
Houston numbers but sometimes﻿ I want a little conversation
I think its time for somebody to notice
That this life is overrated cause Im meant
For something realer than a good time getting faded
She just wanted someone to notice that her hair
Nails did and for somebody to notice that she bad
I havent seen you in forever its been ages
You aint aged a bit
Still the same woman you was back in 06 damn swag
Still so cold, we so throwed, how you been?
Ive been fine, hows your son? He two years old

Ooh weve done that, weve done that, that shit feel all the same
Sick of waking up with women that I do not know they name
And she sick of being forgotten after it come out as Kate
So thats why I went I got her when I saw her body stay
Be like one, two, three and to the four, girl I want you
To break these bitches off
Break em off with ya beautiful self
Babe you look perfect, I dont see nothin you can do that with help
So dont you worry
You bad
And for somebody to notice
And for somebody to notice
And for somebody to notice
That she bad, bad
Poppin bottles for them bitches, gettin faded
Im happy you noticed

Blue green jewels with the supreme fuel
And looking raw up in the cut
While i lay back cool and moving
Right to left, moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left 
Wooden leather, base model never
Holding birds of a feather
And we all are seen together moving
Moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left 
Yo, what i gotta do to get you pussy cat dogs
To not, act hard like I wouldnt jab yall
You a trap-star, cool im a dream catcher
You from New York, stop biting off Atlanta
Pea is a rap terrorist, suicide bomber
Ima blow up me and everybody around me
You cant show up pea im everywhere you try to be
Heres some advice get nice and dont lie to me
In my last 6 I trumped your whole shiznik
Son Ive heard better MCing in limp bizkit
Rappers is rugrats, I am DR. Lipschitz
Come to ya shows theres enough space to park with
Wheres your fanbase, with so much damn grace
I plan your demise over eggs and pancakes
First thought of the day the second one goes
I wont stop until I see TM blow
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon break up fore they meet Drake?
Im sure it can be resolved, Im just hopin that they make up
Im perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, Im known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
Im keepin it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you dont like me, its prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and Im so this, the coldest
Im in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
Im back with the form like Obus
Blue green jewels with the supreme fuel
And looking raw up in the cut
While i lay back cool and moving
Right to left, moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left 
Wooden leather, base model never
Holding birds of a feather
And we all are seen together
Moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left 
And Imma teach it so you learn right
You cant come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take em back like returned flights, yeah
You cant miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and Im a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngins as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and Im a prodigy
What Im direct for, cause Im who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin Connect Four
You was playin Uno, I was doing you know

Im just in the cut sittin sideways
Way that you lookin all the time
Time gets to tickin and it takes a toll
Told you I couldnt really draw the line
Line ringin, sayin that you told him things
Things that you couldve kept inside
Sidetrackin me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind
I know you like to drink til the sun up
Grind til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they dont really miss ya
Rule number one to be a boss-ass bitch
Never let a clown honey try to play you
And if he play you, then rule number two
Is fuck his best friends and make em yes men
Thats how you feel?
Thats how you feel?
Im just in the cut sittin sideways
Way that you lookin all the time
Time, it done left you with a broken heart
Hardly excuses how you play with mine
Mindin my business and then you show up
Up to no good, I shouldve seen the signs
Signin me up to do your dirty work
Workin to try to get you off my mind
I know you like to drink til the sun up
Grind til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya

And if you got a stylist to cop you gear
You in my age bracket, you are not my peer

Frette sheets, perfect touch to a clean house
Wide awake but a nigga livin ya dreams out

He aint ever take you out, barely even left your house
How dare that nigga run his mouth when his pockets in a drought

And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass dont think, ayy
If he disrespect, two shots and I wont blink, ayy
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ayy

And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap all she sing, ayy
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap in her dreams, ayy
Well he mad as fuck, when they sex, she scream for me, ayy

You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation

Something that youve never been!

If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I dont wanna rush into it, if its too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done

I hope that you see this through

When a good thing goes bad its not the end of the world
Its just the end of a world that you had with one boy
And hes the reason it happened, but hes overreacting
And its all because he dont want things to change
So cry if you need to, but I cant stay to watch you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I cant stay to hold you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I cant stay to hear you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Cause youll say you love me, and Ill end up lying
And say I love you, too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Somethings been missing
You know it, oh ho, he knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like were together
Because were scared to see each other with somebody else

Maybach Music
I was nominated, never won a Grammy
But I understand, theyll never understand me
Lot of lives lost, but I never panicked
Lot of lines crossed, I never did a Xanny
A hundred room mansion but I felt abandoned
Love makin’ love, but where will love land me?
Jealous, so their bitches be actin like they sleepin on us
But they speakin’ on us, jewelers quote us even numbers
Still blowin smoke as angels float above us
Love givin back, but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale
Triple beam dream, a buck on the shades
I really seen things give mothers the shakes
I really bought cars for women on face
I know it seem odd, but money amazin
College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it
But we keep pushin, keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin, rebukin the devil
Livin on the edge, she keepin’ me level
Money come and go, I’ma keep you forever
Money come and go, Ima keep you forever 
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma
Coming to America, really the set
I’ll let your soul glow, Im keepin you wet
All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?
Holdin on your hands, your body’s a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, menages with bitches

They love to wait til its too late, too late 
Had a dream she was singin to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left, you wasnt actin right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My money bag heavy, got me packin light
You movin funny, can you fill my appetite?
Niggas conversations, a lot of it false
He own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars, but all of em parked
Your niggas money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, thats not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
Im always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin

You wanna go talk to him
But he doesnt listen
When hes played Enough games
And you played your position
Hell tell you to stay
But youll wanna go
I know

Im so fucking dumb, I wrote diamonds on my thumb
I got a diamond on my dick, so thats a diamond on her tongue
I cant feel you baby, cause Im romanticly numb
Emotionally drained, I came here just so i could cum
Theres nothing under Gods sun, that I havent done
I got a lot of problems, gettin pussy just isnt one
Girls are like buses, every fifteen minutes they run
Now their like potato chips, I just can not have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I dont like yo friends in my business
And I feel like you deserve a Benzy
Cause you wasnt in the kitchen with me, water whippin
Uh uhh uhhhhh, I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you probably tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talkin boo but we just dont believe you
Uh, okay Im all about it, all for it
Im all star team Jordan, small forward
Im never puttin up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitations, so Im shooting if I draw for it
Pow pow, Fuck is up, now Im up in this hoe
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all this minutes go
Mixtape dropped, then I started gettin ten a show
Now I get a hundred, what the fuck you think Im in it for
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, J, and Mack agree
Fuck you to the haters that just spend they time attackin me
Shoutout to youre girlfriend nigga, lately she been distractin me
Wondering if im the best, well I aint no blaceyedpeace
Girls wanna fuck and niggas gotta wanna be you
Linen up around the block, so they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
So you can say whatever girl but we just dont believe you
Uhuuuuuh I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl

What up? This Kim. Damn, I’ve been trying to get at you all week. Why don’t you call me back?
Okay, I lied. Damn, I swear. Just call me back

In a whip so low
No ones gotta know
Knockin on your door
I dont gotta work anymore
You can
Put your phone down, youre gonna need two hands
You cant get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark
Late night like Left Eye, Im creepin
Assuming the worst cause I havent heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if youre duckin calls or missin calls
Cause youve been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I dont know how serious you take it
Cant offer much more, youve heard it before
That narrative for me isnt changin
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know theres more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
Ill be on my way
In a whip so low
No ones gotta know 
Knockin on your door
I dont gotta work anymore 
You can
Put your phone down, youre gonna need two hands
You cant get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark
Oh, me and you, got you wet like the pool
Then Im tryna dive in, put some time in
Get the vibe right, get your mind right
Its gon be a long night
Put your feet in this water, dont wanna get your hair wet
Weve hooked up a couple times, we aint took it there yet
You broke up with your man and aint been with nobody else
You like, Fuck these honeys, rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you cant trust nobody
You said, Do anything, but just dont lie to me
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the shorty, we got Ghosts
And when its after dark then we can coast
In a whip so low
No ones gotta know 
Knockin on your door
I dont gotta work anymore 
You can
Put your phone down, youre gonna need two hands
You cant get enough

Yeah
Heres a song about fucking
I love bad bitches, thats my fucking problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fucking problem 
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fucking problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
If finding somebody real is your fucking problem
 Bring your girl to the crib, maybe we can solve it
I said hi my name is Tim and I admit I got a sickness 
I might just be addicted to putting my dick in bitches 
And I can turn it on, baby I know where the switch is 
And Ima tear it up girl you gon need some stitches
Ugh, and I aint even trying
Every single week Im on a plane- flying
Nosey people always trying to Snoop - Lion
You thinkin its the end, but its not - Mayan
Money on my mind, but my mind is the gutter
And every time she see me, she just spread like butter 
So much under covers that I know we can discover
She pop it like a molly got me asking for another 
But I dont pop pills 
Dont drop E, but I do drop bills 
Cant drop me, Timothy got skills
Drop that beat and the beat got killed, beast!
I love bad bitches, thats my fucking problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fucking problem 
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, thats my fucking problem 
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem 
If finding somebody real is your fucking problem 
 Bring your girl to the crib, maybe we can solve it 
Where the hoes at?
Where the hoes at?

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin with some girls I never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
You and me, we just dont get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you dont belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin with some girls Ive never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if youre bendin over backwards for someone else
Wonder if youre rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin nasty for someone else
You dont need no one else
You dont need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, youre someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city…
Alright, lets see you do your best Drake impression
Something like this
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling

I think youre changing your mind
Starting to see it in your eyes
I used to love a good surprise
And now Id rather know ahead of time
You said I love you too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And were already done
Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they cant see you liking someone just like me
I expected more from you, honestly
Said you want a simple life and thats not me
How you go from that to endin up with someone just like?
How can you be angry on a night in July?
And be warm with me when its freezing outside?
Youre confusin me, dont have me wastin my time
You said I love you too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And were already done
I kept it decent, I kept you sane
I kept it peaceful, dont lie
I kept it decent, even the secrets
Kept it between you and I
Breakin my heart, tearin me apart
Breakin me down when Im already down
Breakin my heart
Breakin my heart, tearin me apart
Breakin me down when Im already down
Breakin my heart
You said I love you too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And were already done
How can you be angry on a night in July?
And be warm with me when its freezing outside?
Youre confusin me, dont have me wastin my time
Dont have me wastin my time
Summer just started and were already done
Summer just started and were already done

Um, you know when I get my Aston Martin
Ill be in there, seats on recline, bad bitch in the passenger
Spliff burning with Matesa on, you feel me?
Lay back, just cruise
Riding to the music, this is how we do it , all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all 
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music
Wouldve came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I cant it let it go 
Whether thats right I will never know
But here goes nothing
Uh, everybody saying remember me
But where the hell is yall memories?
Im searching through walls of my membrane
Its insane, Im entertainin the big names
Through diamond, silver lining on my big frames
Niggas stressin all Im seeing through the Oakleys
Shit depressin, so we investing to blow trees
Had a dream I was chillin in the OC
Then I landed out in Cali where they woke me
Discrete mumbles, from summer to street jungle
Voice from my uncle he tell me to keep humble
But at times I slip into deep wonder
Would they show they support in the event that my feet stumble?
See, when you already on, its harder to say shit
Like the feelin when you dazed and caught in amazement
Girls gotta stay separate from all of your statements
Cause for the most part, hoes want a part of the payment
Im relaxing in the Rolls Royce
Getting money cause I give these hoes no choice
Im all alone in my box, blunt burnin in the zone with my thots, wait
Sometimes a nigga change for the money
Ladies that love me and all of these whips I roll
But buying all the dollars, so why would I holla?
Tryna put my pockets on swole
And I aint got no time, no-no time 
I just got memories, oh no-no, yeah
Riding to the music, this is how we do it , all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music
Wouldve came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do

I took you cause you somewhat of a spokesman for all my haters
A out-of-town nigga that could be on the couch or in the bed
With one of my neighbors
He feel he got the scoop, but this aint ice cream
Ill Math this man then hook, on ice cream
He thinkin Method Man n hook on Ice Cream
Thats why you been Jerry in the circle nigga, no ice cream
So next time youre in your car, tune in I know why cats want to get at you
Your records wouldnt ship at a loading dock
You a nobody like Robocop
SP right only 2 liters like the soda pop
S-P-R-I-T-E 2 anyways
I volleybal your shit then go to the Nets game
You almost died cause a guy felt her thigh and it wasnt a guess game
You be trippin, but staying out of the helicopter route
Cause when we be tripping, we be bringing hella coppers out
Long choppers, clips like a Harley Davidson seat
Give you that loud ride to that place you should be
You a fruit loop with nutrition facts
Clips aint spilling milk cause that wasnt the right house
He went to squab in the kitchen at
You got prostitutes, a Glock to shoot
Lil white bitch that gives you lots of loot
How ironic you promoting that and her ex-boyfriend
The promoter is the one who sent you to the hospital
Hes going to rap about my dick cause he prayed for my incarceration
But my is his cousin
But you wont hear none of that in the bars he came with
Fuck boy, no day in jail
Took myself to the precinct, no Dave Chappelle
Cause I got 3 daughters nigga, I aint take it well
But back to the gutter, you grabbed the clippers
When Charles Hamilton ran on you like you was getting a haircut
And thats the chair you rent out of the shop to make money in
Now that was some sucka, shit
When Charles Hamilton said some shit in his song
I ran down on him in the projects elevator like fuck is this?
So when it come down to who would do what
When a real man step to them, you and him a fucking bitch
You got no shame, used to be a first ave nigga with no fame
Muslim nigga who watch Soul Train
Grew up to date white women, so plain
You got Kevin heart on Soul Plane
If I give a bird, man to a young thug Ima feel a lil weezy
About the whole thing
You asked Lush did he get shot at like you know the shooter
When Lush know a shooter that can get you shot at up close and sooner
You a body! No peace be with you brother Ahmed
Now take these shots! Arm leg a leg a arm head nigga
ICE!
You is family Ice
Now you old, fresh out of bars, and trying to be in Jones position
How ironic cuz
You got the swag of everybody’s uncle that just came home from prison
What up Wolf? They might’ve heard that terminology
But you ain’t break it down properly
So follow me to the Odyssey, back to the block with me
Eighth ave when my moms kicked me out, good thing my aunt a g
RIP, shoutout to Fat Cat, Bogod, Dre Solid b
That’s Wolf, means We Only Love Family, that’s the policy
So why is he, still throwing the Wolf up, well lets be honest g
You been backed up on the pack, let’s get all this shit out
This your colonic b
See you remember Drew Hamilton projects? 17th floor?
I was 17 when you was bagging that raw
In that cellophane, when we sell to fiends
And I was a nosey kid
But he was treating his nose, that’s what the homie did
See he made that work disappear
But you was like the Wizard of Oz and y’all know what a O-Z is
It’s a “O” so them kilos and biz is felonious
Cuz we know Jones is a OG so let’s think about how old he is
See I tried to help you when you was whipping that white girl
Meaning ya girl car
Then I took you from a local nigga to a world star
And what you do, typical, never stay in tune
Wolves don’t worry about getting outshined
You only howl cuz you jealous of the moon
They ask you who you came up with, you never celebrate ya goons
See ICE never say no names but catch em in interrogation rooms
Aww man, lord knows the G’s us
You act hard here boy, but you a hardware store, you made them keys up
He said he G checked T-Rex, please bruh
See Ice box but when it comes to them treys/trays he freeze up
It’s aight you know what I’m saying I do this cuz I got the cheat code
You about to get 84 gram’d, 3-0’s, lets go…
Suck my dick! Straight like that
You don’t gotta make no funny sounds to get punched in yo face like that
We not in the United States, and you don’t know Drake like that
So after this battle if I decide to rob you
You don’t know where the precinct is, so I ain’t stressin a case like that
Nigga I let you taste a bat, or a chrome nozzle
Beat you with the back of a screw driver
In front of a bus full of kids and they school driver
Tell Tashim I miss her head
But if she ever play with me again I’ma send you her body
But it’s gon miss her head
Man miss me with irrelevant fake shit, I don’t take shit
Including pussy, I wipe my ass and doo doo mush em
Cuz to us it’s no clue you pussy
You almost got yourself killed in a fight scene in ya own movie
You ya own groupie
I make you choke yourself with ya own jewelry
Bitch nigga, Casino style
You and ya brother in a ditch nigga
Math punched you in ya face
And had you wandering around like the eye on ya cousin that’s a…
I need to see paper work
You riding around in a Benz like you a go getter
Promoting you got hoes and you a ho nigga
I get ya car washed and bullets will run through yo chest like these gold diggers
You a act who play it well
Have you in that black raised from cells
Cuz the first gat I raised was a gauge at the age of 12
What happened to you being Muslim? Newspapers and bean pies
It’s nothing ludicrous; they all knew you would pork out when it’s beef time
Gun under the shoulder like deodorant balls
You hear rapid barks like a Doberman dog
Then more barks like the owner ain’t home
Now you know that I’m a pet lover
The Desert Eagle will leave you but the Hawkll be ya step brother
Step brotha, bloaw! Stepbrothers, cuz I give you all pops like step mothers
Ice will wet a nigga, you wanna buck it? Challenge
This silver will be under a star like it run with Dallas
Ask Tony Romo or any other street hooker or fag that know he homo
And you’ll see how much power behind these punches
Like watching boxing slo-mo
I should ox ya throat tho!
ICE! Nigga!
I know he got a voice like he still Sumos
But it’s funny to me cuz I know the real you tho
And dog is an old cartoon that ain’t been on in years
But y’all feel Pluto
See I been getting chicken and spinach since a squint in my Pop-eyes
You can’t do me greasy cuz I live oil but I still blew tho
See you a half steppin back stabbing nigga acting Big Daddy Kane
That’s why I’m able to kill you bro
See you sneaky though, like grimey in a bad way
You yell a lot but you never smoked nobody
So don’t be a menace when I use you as an ashtray
See you the type to give the little homie the pump
And then you gas em, petroleum and told em to dump
But I’m like damn wolf why you gassed the lil homie to smoke em?
He like “nah I told that nigga to stop holding the blunt”
My nigga you petty, Reggie and two start telly smelly
Never ready teddy, yeah you pender in the grass, just a Rob Kelly
Fruity, heard you using stems not the one from cherries
Yeah you got that Keisha but you buns, not the one from Belly
Chicken felonies, it’s weird charges, you can’t even tell what they mean
See I’m the bear and you the deer in this here forest, no hook
I’ll AR-AB through ya bars like Kareem
See they thought the swag was you
Nah it’s just what comes with 8th avenue
Ironic I used to watch you baggin up drugs
Now you getting drug while I’m baggin you
See you couldn’t be the plug
So you found a public outlet like ya phone died
For years you’ve been crying for me to peel ya onion
So I’ma cut you thick, the long kind
Do you greasy til ya skin starts to bubble and the foam rise
Yeah that’s how I’ma cook you
Since you claim you love her, love her home fries
You said out ya mouth on camera “Pat Stay so big
When I was in the elevator without a weapon I felt threatened”
On camera, I said “Head stop bitching!”
Then you told K-Shine “real killers can tell by the leg twitch”
No nigga, real killers keep shooting till the leg stop twitching
Yeah it’s alright though, I know how you said step brother
Cuz you 40 and still live with ya moms and you a pet lover?
What does that mean? I ain’t even gon go off the head on you
I’ma keep it cuz you said ya moms dead so it’s dead on you
Foolio!
Now y’all see the difference between me and stupido
Making songs for the money but got famous off of beats without a studio
Speaking of studio, that’s your apartment size
Ya closet a port-a-potty
You can’t flush shit, just give me all you can find
I tell my niggas
Search all the Gucci, Jordan and Prada shoeboxes in the bathroom
Give me yo keys nigga, here search the car
Cuz them 4 doors and that trunk is the last rooms
All I heard was “I found it” I’m like “Cash? Drugs?”
They like “Both! And the coats hanging over the bath tub”
You a walking fake chain, every jeweler make you
I said you’ll walk in, fake, chain, every jew will make you
You got ya style from the lost and found, you ain’t schooling niggas
I could rent out my pad, I’m so super nigga
If I swoop a nigga, over his head, Campbells can
You lookin for souper nigga? Man to man
At my lowest lane you in an ambulance
I told you I was gon bar you, liquor shot
After this I’ma bar you, lick a shot
My boot-leg will run you out of the tenement spot
My bootleg run Serius out the tenement spot
Bars! The same one Bishop thought
He could save Blizzard from that owner pistol
You don’t own a pistol, now see these will burn through your tracks
That’s how I get on it with you
Line for line I’m dancing around em, no Soul Train
Cuz if I give a bird man to a Young Thug I’ma feel a Lil Weezy
About the whole thang
I let apes peel, ooooh baby, if you owed me a meal
I’ll be dead or a serial killer who got locked, worked out
Got so swole in the cage, I’ll really know how apes feel
But I kill 8 family members and we even
Wanna know how we straight? Build
After every murder there’s a family gathering plate
So fuck how my message taste, that’s 8 mills/meals
Jones in the wrong mission, this ain’t Indiana
In the end he Anna, Nicole Smith
OJ, they gon lock you up for stealing ya own shit
I give em the whole brick, y’all thinking 4 quarter kilos
In this house he fall asleep though for being a rat with a peephole
You Pookie belt
Take this nigga outside and kill him 3 times
You get the same murder Pookie felt
All you see is 3 9’s nigga, like the price of a teddy bear in a gift shop
I’ll let this go in the club like the latest hip-hop
On that note, I don’t know who you wanna be, Cat Daddy
I’m mad you related to any of my sons, Cat Daddy
That’s his cousin, you heard him, Cat, Dre, Solid, you heard em
ICE nigga…
That was aight nigga
But from the audience response the hottest bar you ever said here was “ICE NIGGA”
You out here swaggin, but ya watch is falling off so how’s that real gold?
You in ya last round admitting you niggas rush cribs then steal clothes
For the fans that don’t understand, it’s incredible to expectation
Cuz in America it’s less debating
But if you a rapper or a street nigga getting money
The one thing you can’t afford is a federal investigation
Cuz just behind bars they pursuing niggas
Niggas acting like they with the shits but in they raps suing niggas
See I’m from Jersey, sure 
You can get found in a Surf just for suing niggas
I was like born with no arms, it’s like I got a body on my hands
See the guns I wave so big, Tsunami be like “Damn”
See you out of pocket, scrambling in the red zone

Bars, when beef shells crack off easy
But at my peak I’m the guy yo, Taco style
And if I dip and then chip you, you gon here that just bitter nacho sound
See I never got beat up, I got snuffed
But you give the game a black eye for having Ice around

Now you on that Meth and can’t protect ya neck, I know you god 
You was probably on YouTube Inspecting the Deck
But you know I’ll cap a don 
But I got 36 Chambers to shoot at you through

When I mark the spot I make em exercise
You giving work out the shop for hoes
I’m so lazy I never even ask my ex her size
See Ill Will Jamaican called me and said, “you wan rap with Ice?”
Make him smell the blade and get the accent right”
I said “hold up, cuz I don’t even use accents” right
And he said “no you see the axe that you use for Lyt
Well use the same axe ‘pon Ice

This is a nut , about how you did it man
You never hit, so you feel like a silly man
She never mention the spot that you fillin in

Tired of beefin you bums, you cant even pay me enough to react

He took a half and I took the whole thing, you need to slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and its like a ghost town, baby

Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I dont want no credit
If it was me, they wouldnt regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan dead it, yeah

I keep credit cards in cash knots
I keep my darkest shades on til the flash stops
Its for my LA girls getting them implants
And all my DC girls getting them ass shots
Got em for a reason shortie, go ahead buss it open
I keep a secret baby, nothings heard when nothings spoken
Haters talk it like my buzz isnt enough promotion
And I just lost a Gucci sandal in the fucking ocean
Damn, I guess the problems of a teen star
Are confused all the conversations between yall
And dog thats funny, pay me what you know nigga

Girls over there and they talking about

Let Just Do It: Nike shit

Can you roll it? I wish you would..
Have these niggas run their mouth like engines, so
They wish they could. Need to get your mind right
Pussy run your intuitions, bitches only here
To fill the gaps, then them chicks is missing
Them chicks is different - then them chicks be kissing!
Other chicks on the lips - man, that shits exquisite
My place is official, we party all the time
And you should come through with your friend and sip
Bacardi Lime. We dont fuck with them girls who
Think theyre hard to find. They want
Attention all the time, but we hardly find
Im laid back: thats a hard recline
Your girl cheating, and shes about to go down..
Its about to come down..
I got the kush rolled up, Henny in the cup
And thats all I need tonight
Do this shit every night
And we gonna do this shit every night

She moved out of state and shit done went left, shes seekin forgiveness

She got a business plan, but she just aint had time to write it down
Stay with her sister now, she got a man, but he out of town
Soon as he out of town, they hop in his whip and they ride around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin, slidin
Thought about trappin a player before, but that just aint right, right
Look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
You popped a 325, you feelin too good to worry tonight
She moved out of state and shit done went left, shes seekin forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business

How could I fly, but lose it all
Im a cannonball
Maybe youll walk away, maybe youll walk away
Set me up, and let me off
Im a cannonball
Like my big bro say, Im goin in
Olimpic loser money, I just glad I learned to swim
CAnnonball, bitch, I hope dive untill its 30
And I hope when dinners cold, my fingers do not dessert me
And these haters like, damb m
Gave a lot of women they first ride in the phantom
And yeah, I got a deal now, and Im secure with it
And yet my life is so exciting, I get bored with it
Im the best one out of my peers, and everybody pray Im running out of ideas
Past my MOs, cause I shine so bright
And Im the result of when it all goes right
So many pictures, man, the floor is a collage
Critics have hard time pointing out the flaws
All this slick talk, I just hope I dont fall
Right out of the sky, through the roof of your garage
How could I fly, but lose it all
Im a cannonball
Maybe youll walk away, maybe youll walk away
Set me up, and let me off

Oh yeah, yeah 
This is what you want 
This is what you want
Have another bottle with me 
Smoke a few blunts with me 
Sun is up, summer time on it 

I got my eyes on you
Youre everything that I see

When they see the chain, yeah, they know it’s Ratatouille 
She say Im in South Africa I make a movie 

Wild things youre doin at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin it all just to feel things
Drinkings enough of a vice
Drugs just arent suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing

All of a sudden you say that I closed the door
It dont matter to me
It dont matter to me what you say

I cant recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to go and put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I cant jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
Youre actin out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin over somethin

Thats not the way to get over me
I dont know what youre sayin

How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that Ive been through?
Its been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, lets get right, now that Im here, baby
Show me a good time
I live for the moments that I will remember
With the people that I might forget
Depending on big-headed I become
And depending on how stubborn and hype I get
I live for the life that I want right now, now, now
But sadly now doesnt come that quick
And I just hate how, how, how
Changing way too hard to fix
Ima star to pick my cars and whips
And I aint even made it that far to begin
I go hard for the win but my heart is thin
So failure to me is where I start to quit
So when I start to finish my ego tripping just ends up missing
How can you show me a good time when I aint even there to begin with
How about you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight, and worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl, cant get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne, presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
People really hate it when a backpack rapper get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could: its in our nature
Young and rich and out of control out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though, so Imma spend another 10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded

Passin up on my old ways
I cant blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin up on my old ways
I cant blame you, no, no
Listen
Harder buildin trust from a distance

Dont pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin up on my old ways
I cant blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin up on my old ways

Grown man bars, that’s something you gotta deal with
No matter how many times you use that catchphrase
We’ll still know you’re a real bitch
See I’m the same man on or off the camera
You was propaganda
Real life; lots of manners, proper grammar, do whatever the doc asks ya
I’m getting lean, no strength machines
I mean promethazine with the jolly ranchers
Come on my strip I’ll take ya top off like exotic dancers
I T-Rex, get eaten alive here by these Toronto Raptors
Become a fossil after, I don’t even know why you spit bro
So since you can’t bust a rhyme 
Then I’ma eat em like you Flipmode
So Gimme Some Mo cuz “This shit Dangerous Rex
So Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See yo I’ma Break Ya Neck”
I was in ya car Rex, with a girl that T bone
You know giving me a ride
Nah bring it back, you’ll be in a car wreck when ya T bone
So it’s only right I hit it on the side
I’ll have Randys family drown, buried where they can’t be found
Like I just got a camera for a gift, I can’t put that cannon/Canon down
See that first can hit em with a slap, you still stand your ground
T too small, the second hand close/clothes like hand-me-downs
You say you rolling with Dot Mob they’re bitches
Bunch of Smack rappers crossing borders, they’re snitches
You see this rat get stripped ass naked, bare witness
You just as delusional as him if you believe anything he saying thought
This guy gets all his world news from the Grand Theft Auto radio
I got that hardcore crew with short fuses, we’re sore losers
Of course shooters we Jedi Mind force users
I’m the reason for my torn future, sworn looper
We storm troopers like George Lucas and you’re useless
Laughing while you messed the fuck up like porn bloopers
See bringing Mook with you, it clearly didn’t help
So do what you do best and start embarrassing yourself, Rex
Grown man bars, something he gotta deal with
No matter how many of them times he fuck with them Canada drugs
He need to come to Harlem to get some real shit
Blackout 5, you know they had to have me in the spot
A nigga that’ll sneak up on you while you put the key in the lock
I pull it out and then squeeze it and… shoutout to Organik
You done brought the King Of the Dots to the King Of The Dot
This nigga beating me? Not a chance
This shit is sorta like a fumble, it done got outta hand
I’ll pick it up, cock it.. wait, wait, wait…
This shit gon be like Hitman loading up a gun
All you gon see is bullets in Holla hand 
I couldn’t bring my hammer on the flight now
But it’s a guarantee my Dot Mob niggas is crossing that Canada bridge
Right now
And every gun that they got been cleaned off, wiped down
Cuz I been waiting to kill me a white nigga since Mike Brown
This nigga beating me? You think I came all the way this far to lose? Not!
Especially to a overhype nigga that smoke moon rocks
4-5th so big, it’ll make the moon rock
Let off a few shots, send that nigga to the boondocks
This ratchet that I carry don’t come out a toolbox
I’ll have doctors repairing his soul/sole like a shoe shop
The options I’ma give em… Boom! Boom! Boom! Bop!
I promise you gon see a BIG murder like Mook popped
I be feeling like Delonte West when it’s time to squeeze mine
Cuz with this ratchet I’m packing I could hit the King moms
See I’m leaving with this nigga head
I give the white people permission to say it… THIS NIGGA DEAD!
You brought ya crew, and Mook I give you props dog
You the king of the Dot Mob
Well let me introduce you to the King Of The Dot Mob
See this bitch is a fake
You ain’t here to support Rex, this Toronto you just dickriding Drake
See the date of my birth place, dark skies, earthquakes
I find it fucked up, but everyone knows you a Nurse aye
Well first off your firstborn gonna need first aid
Have Randy son in the hospital like take ya kid to work day
See Top 5 ya name don’t show up like a private number
In my world T-Rexes don’t exist like a bible thumper
Wait, now I get it, T-Rex, this bitch so sloppy
Them lil ass arms on this big old body
See I’ve been destined to be dead or in prison
But tonight I’m sent on a mission
Leaving Rex hard to look at like a head-on collision
I always got a little buzz
I’ll have him shitting blood while I hit em with the snub
Put a couple in em, another couple in em
Fuck it another couple in em, call it a swingers club
Anything in arms reach could be a murder weapon
You saying all my dogs Nazis, German Sheppards
But scars last forever like a first impression
Your intestines on the floor when you spilling ya guts
Out in front of God like a church confession
Organik, he didn’t even pay me to rap, I’m a hired goon
Shit’s real, keep ya lips SEALed, Heidi Klum
Cuz I? I’ll kill a man in Stone Cold blood
For a kilogram of home grown bud
You crazy, better wish that they don’t phone us
Cuz we’ll get busy in the flesh like some old Bone Thugz
It ain’t classified information, I’m Nova Scotia’s most sick
That can under my shirt in the club like I’m going to the smoke pit
So winning Total Slaughter for your career, it clearly didn’t help
Do what you do best, keep embarrassing yourself Rex
I admit, last time niggas saw me
I wasn’t the same Rex that y’all was used to seeing
But in 15 years I finally dropped the ball once, shit I’m a human being
I wasn’t myself at all, you could see it
Cuz what you used to seeing is Rugers squeezing
Bunch of pipes smoking like it’s a Hookah meeting
I ain’t one of them niggas to get involved with
Whenever I get into some long shit you’ll see them 4s spit
Any nigga could die when you walkin into that large stick
Cuz I can guarantee you I’m taking you to a mosh pit
A lot of niggas talk battle but they ain’t bout that
That shit you always say in ya rhymes show me you bout that
I caught him with that hammer that’s cocked like “where ya house at?”
All that shit you talking, that hammer be where ya mouth at
A lot of niggas die talking that real shit
I’m from a real borough where niggas done came and killed shit
45 on him, run up on you and spill shit
I got some dope for you, give you that Yung Ill shit
I ain’t come to Canada to lose nigga
I came to Canada just to abuse niggas
Me and Mook against you and Pat Stay
We could do it, a two on two nigga
Kill you on camera, put this body on the news nigga
Ask about me I blast shit, we could get into some real drama
If that’s really what you want to happen
But I’m representing for New York just not Manhattan
Where Dizaster at? Tell em we could squash all that Math shit
See I’m leaving with this nigga head
Y’all niggas know how I give it up… THIS NIGGA DEAD!
I know in my battles sometimes
I glorify being a junkie and meth abuser, I stay noble
Some people online like to gossip and spread rumors
Against Clips they say I dissed Bruce for reaction
Like I’m some pathetic loser
He was looking down laughing
Who better than his best friend to know his sense of humor
And you ain’t no OG, you just old enough to be my dad and shit
You ain’t pushing white or stacking bricks
This pussy’s life’s action-less like a Women’s Rights Activists
He admitted he never owned a gun, but we was out last night
Shit, you pro-abortion, he ain’t about that life
See me, I’m straight hustling, the fiends serve em heavy
Don’t make me hold that Big Mac out like I’m Cheeseburger Eddie
Flip green through the days, spend the night at ya crack seller
This Son of Anarchy shoot at his mother head, Jack’s teller
There’s guns everywhere, couple in the leather jackets
My homie keeps the chopper under his hat like Inspector Gadget
I lugged ya body cross the country in the winter man
Chop ya family tree and let it crush you in the timber-land
I stomp a hole so bad in T-Rex ruined a boot
Straight up, Canadian round a bout, I roond-aboot
I spit a verse, you could watch how fast ya clique disperse
With them weak rhymes they say T died like a hippie shirt
In a stick up you the first to hand me ya paper, my best student
Make you cough up the green like ya phlegm’s putrid
Rex stupid, trying to guess how many blades that Jeff using
Just 3 in the front, still 1 in the back, Gillette Fusion
It’s always 3-0’s with me, no doubt it would be a massacre
Cause in the end I’ll just keep dumping, call it finale of The Bachelor
Reality shows I’m the Ultimate Fighter
You find out, get smothered, we know who be the Survivor
You ain’t that Big Brother
See all these rats in this Amazing Race
Better search for the exits and plan your great escape
Shooters surround you while you sleeping, you should’ve stayed awake
It’ll open up his eyes when I give em The Sign like Ace Of Base
All I hear is gun bars we want gun bars, but it’s subpar
Man I’m that genius on it, to see this gay club you want drug bars
Middle of the night, light of the fridge when you look for snacks
Have that burner smoking in the kitchen like I’m cooking crack
Beautiful weapons, hot knives
See I don’t need the gun tonight, the blades red
Like smoking hash on the oven off a butter knife
So how can you be the face of URL?!
When since birth I bang needles, smoke pipe
I should be running the Ultimate Rap League
Cause I been on Smack my whole life!
I’m a lil serious when I rap so I ain’t got no joke for ya
I wish they could cut the cameras off when I say this shit
But since we in the same hotel I got some coke for you
Fuck it you want gun bars? Them bullets spitting like they on fast forward
Shot em in slo-mo, shit I was too fast for it
Silencer on Halloween, the hammer got a mask on it
We don’t deal with no corn beef unless it’s hash on it
We let them triggers blow, let ya niggas know
My niggas sold so much birds we walk pigeon toed
Rain, sleet, we be in the snow, getting rid of snow
Grew up broke, only thing for dinner was a dinner roll
I understand why they did this battle this way
You wanted it to be like… street nigga versus a crack- like aight cool
This is the hustler vers’ the customer
He was the aggressive crackhead that be on the corner like
“I don’t want that shit Rex got, I’m waiting till that butter come!
This nigga kinda diesel, fuck it Mook
We ain’t gon try and give him a one on one
But fine, we gon swing from both sides like Double Dutch
Niggas tell me that this guy was real
He got the squeezers in the palm
Kinda tough where he from, they believe em, he a don
Well not me, I run up on him and put the heater to his moms
They won’t be able to save em
Cuz they’ll find em dead in a chair with a needle in his arm
You think I came here to talk some junk shit?
Well I’m from the block, I really came here to talk some coke shit
I know you gon feel it cuz I’m talking some dope shit!
They brought me to King Of The Dot just to tell you about the crack I got
Took me a minute to get through customs
They damn near found the pack I got
He the type of nigga that’s playing defense so he wanna block my rock
But I ain’t gon let a nigga get a chance to block my shot
“Too-too… boop boop!” from the Glock I got
T with me “Chalaka-budabahbahbop!”
Make em fall all on the floor from the Glock I got
Daylyt with me, a nigga can’t Dot my Mob
I ain’t no joking ass nigga
I ain’t one of these regular rapping smoking ass niggas
And I ain’t gon be wrestling with this Hulk Hogan ass nigga
See I’m leaving with this nigga head

Living at my mama’s house wed argue every month
Nigga, I was trying to get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like “Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think its funny how it goes
Now I’m on the road, half a million for a show
And we started from the bottom now we here

I feel good, I cant even sing but Im gonna try
Sike
Maybe you can call in sick
Bring it to the room and get all this dick
Yo, I still got that voice that will make you go insane
Ive been thinking about you Frank Ocean Novacaine
I get you wetter than the streets when its pouring rain
And we can stay home like high school on snowy days
You know the name if not, then that dont even matter
Im always on the run like I got a leaky bladder
Im the shit like fecal matter
You dont trust me, I wonder why, cause Im a freaking rapper?
Read the chapter baby dont ignore me
Or watch the show when its Boy Meets World, Topanga Ill be Cory
I apologize if this seems kinda corny
But I got these teenage hormones, Im kinda horny
That kind of stuff will probably make you wonder
Do I like freaky girls like Gucci and get them in a hummer
I probably do but just listen honey
Thats probably true but just listen honey
I feel good, I got some time off girl its been so long
Did you have fun, cause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring it to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know Im blunt but how real is that
You want this feeling back, well you should know
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go, its better than you know
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go, its better than you know
Yo, I still got all of these feelings Ive been keeping
Never showed emotion to these chicks that I was freaking
I be missing you like every single weekend
I know you got my voicemails, never kept it a secret
And if you speechless let me tell you what it really is
Im a changed man, used to be a silly kid
Listen to the rumors, things I never really did
Always tell the truth, never fake, see I really 
Shit, I see you trying to do your own thing
But just tell me if you miss me too
I wasnt ready for commitment back then
But now Ill let you tie me down, something like a tennis shoe
And now I got bread I could grow, we can go do some things that we dont normally get to do
So got a thing for me, Ill let it if you tell me that it isnt true
I feel good, I got some time off girl its been so long
Did you have fun, cause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring it to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know Im blunt but how real is that
You want this feeling back, well you should know
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you

I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go, its better than you know

It could all be so simple
But youd rather make it hard
Loving is you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars
Tell me who I have to be
To get some rest and 
’Cause no one loves you more than me
No one ever will
No matter how I think grow
You always seem to let me know
It aint working, it aint working
And when i try to walk away
You hide yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy
I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself
As painful as this thing has been
I just can’t be with no one else
You let go and Ill let go too
Cause no ones hurt me more than you
And no one ever will
No matter how I think grow
You always seem to let me know
It aint working, it aint working
And when i try to walk away
You hide yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy
Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me
There for me, there for me
Said youd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said youd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won’t you live for me?
Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you’d be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said youd die for me
Give to me

Its hard to go from kid tv show to rapper
It is, it is, but you know, the more and more, we were consistent, it proved, it turned from a flaw to an attribute. You know, its like, it makes the story better, I think at this point
Especially when the music is good and theyre like, yo hes real
We started just putting songs out-

I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing Ive ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas

Super good smidoke, a package of the Swishers

You live a double life and your mouth run like you get two lives
Youre loose with it
You know my Startrax niggas, they produce with it
...my buisness
Only take the pistol out your mouth to talk business, fuck niggas
I feel like Papa Johns, I got a rocket launcher

Life, sometimes it feels like she treats other people better then you
And you want her to treat you better
Shit, treat that bitch right man
And she will
The money, fame, and power, I aint seen it yet
But people linin up like I wonder what we can get
It aint a problem, but when I know this my friends
Coming back when theres some ends and running back when that shit ends
Its kinda funny, I guess the money makes them act a little strange
It dont change the person with it, just the people in yo space
Im spacing out, my brain is orbiting
I stare up at the galaxy at night like Im absorbing it
Cause thats my only pal, there aint a doubt in mind
The only one that I can turn to when Im out of time
You treat your life well, that bitch will treat you fine
Theres always silver-lining, just read between the signs
The great divine rest upon my shoulders
I was meant for higher purpose those of us who wear ?
Id live forever if she let me hope she will
Cause this life is just to good to be this real
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me baby its real
And I say I aint doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere
But here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she wont
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Its hardwired in my brain, the music thang
Thats the gift that life has given to me like a fuel to flame
And see my gift back is what I am because of it
The game is waitin on me cause they know Im on some other shit
Sometimes you gotta take a step back and ask yourself
Is it my time yet, what am I after?
Well, Im after wealth but thats the big picture forever
So meanwhile Ive been playing chess up on your checkerboards
Im breaking all the rules
Im in the fast lane holding up the traffic moving carefully and past games
They say the ones that have it all, they took the time for it
I want the world in my palms, Ive got the time for it
Cause this is my life, Im in control of it
Shes worked all of the pain and all the years that I was broke for this
Id live forever if she let me hope she will
Cause this life is just to good to be this real

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin with some girls Ive never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just dont get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you dont belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls Ive never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if youre bendin over backwards for someone else
Wonder if youre rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin nasty for someone else
You dont need no one else
You dont need nobody else, no
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling

Yeah I stay down with my day one niggas and we in the club screaming
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
Still here with my day one niggas, so you hear me say
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I still ride with my day one niggas, I dont really need
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I stay down from day one so I say
Fuck all yall niggas except my niggas
Fuck all yall niggas except my niggas
One more time
Fuck all yall niggas except my niggas
Fuck all yall niggas, stay down from day one so I say
Yall niggas dont matter, youre really unimportant
Finna hit it, get it stacked up, you already support it
Spitting flow so sick that my vision get distorted
Slow it down for you niggas, cant afford to miss a moment
Fast-forward mass euphoria
Get it from my story, yeah
Me and Stunna met before we thought the fame in store for us
Threw a couple lines down, thought it was stupid
Wrote it for my nigga, wasnt really into music
That was three years ago, now this is what Im doing
Diving in the game, feeling like Im parachuting
Ima win it all, I aint really into losing
All Im losing is my mind, isnt like I ever use it
Ima bring it hard, industry will get bruises
Im a hard choice but a nigga finna choose it
My friends and I a package deal
All this time and I havent still made any
Signed a contract with Paper Stunnas in 11
Since then in the studio, thats heaven
Cause Im with my brother, and Nameless making cash
Rollin with no other cause new niggasll get in your ass
Thats why I been in the same studio
This humid cubicle
Since I was rockin skinnies and bumpin Snoop D-O
Fucking unruly hoes
Paper Stunnas never disappoint
From emotional tracks to the hottest joints
Thats why I be with the illest team
In the industry
No one as ill as we
Packin delivery
Rollin with the same niggas since the beginning
I swear to Jah the only new people I meet is the women
Fuck all yall niggas except my niggas

I got my eyes on you
Youre everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I cant get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
Cause youre a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause youre a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
But just hold on, were going home
But just hold on, were going home
Its hard to do these things alone
But just hold on, were going home
I got my eyes on you
Youre everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I cant get over you
Left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
Cause youre a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause youre a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, were going home
Just hold on, were going home
Its hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, were going home
Youre the girl, youre the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think theres something
Well youre the girl, youre the one
I gave you everything I loved
I think theres something, baby
Yeah yeah yeah

I dont know if what we have is love, but its on my mind
We might slide on a  inside this club, girl, close your eyes
Fifteen brothers, no friends when I pull up, for peace of mind
Lights come on, Ima need you to come find me, dont be so shy
Cause I know you want me, girl

Cause I know you want me, girl
Cause I know you want me
Want me, girl 
Cause I know you want me

I know you want me cause your BD is a goofy
Boss you up, your lifestyle could be exclusive
But I dont know, cause you be hangin round with losers
Internet trolls and  tryna do me
650S, , I feel like Lil Boosie
You want me, so do all your friends, is you stupid?
Stop complaining to me, I am not the one you love
Aint comin over late night, dont want no shoulder rubs
In the trenches every night, , Im holdin guns
Hold me down or could you slow me down?
Im a dog cause you really know me now?
On black and white just cause Im gettin holy now?
Another reason Ima have to slow it down
Snakes in the grass, you know I had to blow em down
We at the club, all my  down to slide
Look for the bright lights, I aint really hard to find
We at the club, all my  down to slide
Look for the bright lights, I aint really hard to find, the Ruler
I dont know if what we have is love, but its on my mind
We might slide on a  inside this club, girl, close your eyes

We just cool, bro, you gettin too excited
Aint seen your face when I was up on that indictment
Aint get a letter, I was strugglin and fightin
With these peoples, they was demons
Tried to put me in a cage, was sayin, Free me
Now we on TV, drag racin at 8A
Rugrats in the car, we was Bebes
Ayy, baby, was your name on any JPays?
Got the audacity to talk to me crazy, you buggin
I dont know if what we have is love, but its on my mind
We might slide on a  inside this club, girl, close your eyes
Fifteen brothers, no friends when I pull up, for peace of mind
Lights come on, Ima need you to come find me, dont be so shy
Cause I know you want me, girl
Cause I know you want me, girl

Gotta stutter when you say DaBaby
My phone keep on ringin, act like I dont see it
Your negative energy fuck up my vibe
Sending me threats, telling me you outside
Goofs in your high school to fuck up my ride
Said you did it again, said it is what it is
Scratching my shit, I go paint it again
Flatten my tires, I get bigger rims
That girl smile and I hit all her friends
And she know Im a dog, Im dog, Im a dog
Worked real hard, finna take a vacation
Id rather do this shit on my own
Dont give a fuck how much longer it takes me
I never fucked with these niggas before
I fuck with em now so they feel like I made it
Talking subliminal, this shit is pitiful
How they let that nigga feel like famous?
God damn, lets see act these niggas gon act
Your bitch around me, its a wrap
I just sent her a pic on the Snap
Im gon hit your lil bitch from the back
It go down in the DM, I put her to sleep, got a Tylenol, PM
Thats your baby momma, I call her my BM
They hating on John cause they all wanna be him
I really dont understand why niggas hating on me, all it took was some time and some patient
I got a whole lot of fine bitches waiting on me cause they know one day Ima be famous
I got a whole lot of people that need me to feed em
They know that I got em, I wont ever leave em
I dropped out of college and start makin more than my teachers
Now all the bitches, they love me
And the niggas they hate me
Cause they all wanna fuck me, woah, woah
As long as nobody touch me, we gon keep gettin money
We aint worried bout nothing, no
Your girl might need some dick in her life
Dont even lie, she get in your ride
I pull out that dick and she know how to ride
Pull your seat-belt, I dont know how to drive
I treat your ho like a ho all the time
Never I wanted your ho over mine
Say thats a lie, but you know she be lyin, hey

Look, I aint never had a benzo
Nope, I pushed me an Ac wit the tintzo
Nosey niggas is peakin in my window
Have a hard time looking
I tell you second hand thats a hard grind cooking
Cause my pop was in it so deep
If his son wanted in it these dealers would probably drop percentage
Instead, I drop bars like Im two months sober
Its my time now so them you months over
Yeah if I want it I find me a way to get that
Im trying to get to the point where I can sit back
Took a lot of patience and action
I grind so Im anticipating relaxing
Im thinking bout replacing the Jacksons on top of the charts
I dont need brothers fillin space in the back than
So from the kid with the sun tan flow
The hottest ticket in town to this one man show
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that its me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that its me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E
I can easily makeem admit to bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah you best believe that I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So they dont like me and throw parties and yet they never invite me
I cant lie sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm and its obvious so who can tell
And no this aint Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection though we both got the light complexion
Couple things that I do that well
And the way that I Jack-son you think that Drake new Sam-L 
Ive been real though 
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See Im humble but I live vain
With more deals on the table than a bridge game
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that its me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that its me I be

These days, all I do is
Wonder if youre bendin over backwards for someone else
Wonder if youre rollin up a backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin nasty for someone else
You dont need no one else

Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in a zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, youre someone else
Outro

Original song & lyrics by Drake
Lyrics Re-structured & Remixed By EA$Y TAVEN

...and wanna take your ass up and down the court
Fly across the border to the 416, 416, 416

Today? That should be my day of no luck
It’s the thirteenth/ weren’t we here just a second ago?
Oh, a year maybe? That’s my reckoning so
Recollecting on how we disconnected
I fell through the cracks/ came back nauseated
And hating the fact my insecurities kept pulling me down for real
So sick/ couldn’t go/ feeling to throw up
I was torn up/ thoughts tormented and so fucked
Going insane ‘cause I chose one
Couldn’t fathom ever having to let her go
And you know what? I’d be lying in my bed
Stare up the ceiling ‘til the minute that she’d walk by
And step inside/ say ‘hi’/ chill a bit
Then at best give a hug or a goodbye and yet
I would pray she stayed like the days that we lost
Making our way to the way that we was
But my major mistake — I remained unlocked
Put my all on display but then failure popped
Wave after wave but I still gave a fuck
Wish I was making this up but I’m not
There were days I would wake up and then doze straight off
‘Cause I couldn’t deal with it
Mind, body, soul set ablaze/ make it stop!
I would say to myself/ hate how I felt
This girl got me so dishevelled to the point
That the Devil himself couldn’t take it
And put in a request that I’d be sent straight out of Hell
I’m not one to place the blame for any of this major pain
That I was put through/ wishing you would say name
Because I felt hurt/ trapped in this cell worth less
And I ain’t even got to the L word yet
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you
Say ‘baby, I love you’
If you ain’t running game
Say my name say my name
You acting kinda shady
Baby why the sudden change?
Say my name say my name
Say my name, ooh
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you
See I felt hurt
But I never gave up/ I was mad/ too attached
I was dumb/ I was blind/ I was axing the facts
Ignoring every instinct/ collapse ‘em and act
Like everything was okay/ I was being me
Then I started seeing cracks/ soon enough
There was no way I could ever feel like I’d match up
To these man you would hang with so I backed up
Struggling in silence/ muffling my voice
No more muscle to get violent
Stepped up a gear still I felt like my rebuttal had no mileage
Tired out/ drained and trapped in this madness/ unh
At times I could swear I was an actor
Tryna be like these guys/ oh my…
Think back like “KD, why would you do that shit?!”
Selling out just to tell ‘em how you were there
Take notice but still you would let her down
You dived in headfirst/ got hurt and that’s it
Better man up and stand up and act in a manner
That won’t go expose just how deeply enamoured
You are with this girl and then damage your status
Shatter your chances/ your heart and your sanity
Man I remember that happening back then how manic I felt
What I had with this girl brought me back to anxiety 
Who the fuck was I tryna be?! 
Couldn’t help but think rightfully 
That you’d never be mine fully 
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you
Say ‘baby, I love you’
If you ain’t running game
Say my name say my name
You acting kinda shady
Baby why the sudden change?
Say my name say my name
Say my name, ooh
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you
So a year back from today
I was in my room with a few tracks I could play
As a soundtrack to my night
We had talked/ sorted shit/ got along
No scraps on the plate but we still weren’t acting the same
Sat back had this one track on replay
Then I realised next day it was V Day
Fuck! We weren’t together but we were
So was I obliged to assign you a gift
And remind you of how much I liked you? Shit…
So I dashed out to get you some flowers but they were sold out
 Came back to my seat so defeated
I think that you came home late with some flowers and gifts
That some other guy showered you with
I ain’t gonna lie/ I was down I was pissed
Felt like I lost all power from my grip
I was bound to this black cloud hounding me
Sick…but I didn’t show anger aimed at a man that I didn’t know
Fuck that! I was down for that shit
Tryna decode everything you were saying
I was overthinking all these codes and meanings
In my Mona Lisa in the hope one day that you’d know I mean it
‘Cause the coldest feeling was not knowing
You see its…
Fast forward past all the bullshit and let’s look at March onwards
Skip ahead to tonight where I’m with you
But this time I got my flowers and gifts all ready to surprise you
It’s only now I look back ‘cause I can with a smile
Yeah we had those times/ you get mad all the time
But nowadays I don’t even have to ask if you wanna be my Valentine
I would never say that…

Took niggas out the hood like Im from there
So you know its all good when I come there
I hear you talk about your city like you run that
And I brought my tour to your city, you my son there, nigga
But I had to come through for the remix
On my haven’t-done-a-verse-in-eight-weeks shit
And if a nigga say my name, he the hot shit
But if I say the nigga name, he still the hot shit
Fucked up, lucky I dont feed into the gossip
Niggas act like they dont know, but they should know
Yeah, I just think its funny how they dangling the bait
But Im the one thats killing niggas on the hooks, though
And niggas aint got a grill, still ice-grill hating
I know yall already know Mike Will Made It
Just looking at the numbers, nigga, I feel amazing

Hotline Bling, take 76
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city you
Started wearing less and goin out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin with some girls Ive never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
-Mr. Cheese, Drake on 2
-Hello, Drake? Yeah, its Richard Cheese

Came to town with Death Cab for Cutie
I stayed home with my wife and child
And a six pack of beer
I pondered that name for 15 minutes
After I saw the poster stapled to a phone pole
On the corner of Grand and 21st
That was a couple of years ago
I was already in my forties then
So I didnt go out on a whim just to see
A band called Alpha Male & The Canine Mystery Blood
Just because I liked the name
Just because Im 25 and every days a stoned summer day
My bands always giggin then
REM was still kickin then
I drove that Ford Grenada Mom and Dad gave to me
After they got em a Ford LTD
And there was music on MTV
I smoked my managers pot
And got laid quite a lot
Planes hadnt flown into towers yet
And we didnt have a loose cannon president
We didnt have all this credit card debt
Hangin over the house like a cloud
Ensurin theres not much more druggin allowed
A body wont take it, wallet cant hang
Singin all the songs Ive sang for years
And when its a band gig its rockin
And when its solo the people are talkin while Im singin
Make me depressed, you think I could take a hint?
My time came and went
Hell theres many nights I came and went
In a manner of speaking my conscience is sleeping
The world is changing the good times are gone
We get to be the folks who greet the dawn
Of an age of distrust, surveillance and sleaze
And bombs in shoes and way too many enemies
I bet their name was Menstrual Blood
And the A&R guy said Thats no good
Make it Mystery and then we can target
A broader base of Goth dog lover market
I love my boy, hes becoming a drummer
Got a drum kit from Santa, at this rate by summer
Hell be keepin a beat in a world that needs a metronome
Shoved up its ass so hard that
All voices will raise in the heavenly choir
Shitll get straight, brothers will hug
Well dance like we did in the decades of drugs
Im spittin my genes in an ocean thats risin
Clingin to Jesus with some compromisin
Of how it was handed to me from my mom
And my daddy the preacher who watched all that TV
In a cream recliner
Scroungin through life like a stoned hardliner
You couldnt faze him, he knew Jesus
Died for his sins and was raised from the dead
And Ive always wondered, why cant he stay dead?
It doesnt change any good thing he said
What matters is his life and not how he died
Why cant he just be a nice Jewish guy?
Who was super clued in and showed us the way
To salvation from sin
And that doesnt mean that youre not quote-unquote saved
You fry like a piece of country ham in your grave
Its a great big world, life is a joke
Arabs and Christians, Pepsi and Coke
People so gorgeous it causes em pain
And nobody gives any sympathy for something like that
You suffer in silence or form a band
With a name that appeals to Goth dog lovers everywhere
On a poster thats seen by a forty-ish bastard
Walkin to work at 8:15
$11 an hour for all that he does
Cant be a has-been if you never was
Goin all day long without eatin
Till all my nerve endings are seriously overheatin
I get wobbly walkin down the stairs
To smoke me a cigarette in the cold fresh air
Wonderin why I do the things I do
And I do em every day
And it cant turn out good livin this way
But live this life I must and
In some fuzzy God I trust
Ill kiss my wife, Ill kiss my son and
Maybe someday Ill go for a run
Maybe someday a song will stick
Ill walk around like I got a big boat
Maybe someday my boyll drum in a
Hippie jam band that plays out some
Hell take after Daddy, get in the van
Go somewhere only young people can
Doing things only young people do
Bangin those skins at Bonnaroo
Rockin the dreadheads, dancin in the mud
Before Alpha Male & The Canine Mystery Blood

Jesus help me
Please just help me
Come right back again
Everythings okay
At least thats what
I tell my friends
But its all made up
And i have changed
Just make it for the best
Cuz it is if you say so
Say
Sittin in a spin
Telling everybody where i been
But its getting old
Wanna go back to me and my friends
When he hit the club
Everybody wanna see em
Tellin me to drink up
Really drink up but I really dont drink like that

Why they in my biz
Why is everybody on my phone

Secrets in my lines ?

To my city

Dawg!
Uh
Slide for my n!
Stay Scheming, raise demons
All you haters fk yourselves face to face penis
Can’t do it like I do it they just stay dreaming
I’m the truest if it’s music, on the stage screaming
Back to back a couple Jordans like I made millions
Just some thousand dollars
Regular whip!
Got some mileage
Trying to plot on me, they treat me like a graph book
Barack Obama or depict me as a mad Bush
‘cause I’m ruling this
My music now got mega downloads, so you could say I’m doing swizz
Quick to holla if she look like Alicia Keys
A couple chains on me, looking like I’m Mister T
I got them thangs! on me, looking like I’m with police
But I’m not with the law; I don’t roll with the badges
I rep the green white green, now you know what the flag is
Polo beneath my jeans, it will show when I sag it
Trying to play me for a joke, all these n clueless
I make the desert storm; it’s nothing like fabolous music
What ’re you scheming for? I don’t see your reason
You claim you’re shooting like you’re Kobe I don’t see your season
 X 2
Slide for my NiZ dawg!, ride for my Niz Uh!
I’ve been trying all my life to fight my stomach growlings
My Pops told me that to be a man takes more than violence
I’m just trying to get a nut, like a couple almonds
My real niz stacking up, labor for allowance
But I’m kind ‘a imbalanced, when my paper’s deficit
Searching for a hustle, like another way to get at it
Tried to make a video, was looking for a camera guy
Took my money from me, left me nothing I was traumatized
Fk Jordan tower films, a couple bullets shower him, 
A couple bullets shower him
Fk Jordan tower films, a couple bullets shower him…him
Couple bullets shower him!

People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, Im just proud of the fact that youve done it your way
And the weekends here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If theyre the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, oh
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?

We musta been here before, its still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but wont find
You musta done this before, this cant be your first time
They keep telling me dont save you, if I ignore all that advice
Then something isnt right, then who will I complain to?
But the weekends here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
Theres things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, were perfect for each other
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this cant be your first time
We musta been here before, its still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but wont find
You musta done this before, this cant be your first time
Cause to her Im just a rapper, and soon shell have met another
So if tonights an accident, tomorrow well recover
And I know Im not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I dont wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if Im with it, and Im with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wan know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this aint your first, but its better than your last; Tunechi
You musta done this before, this cant be your first time
We musta been here before, its still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but wont find

Ooh ahh

From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit

I could tell it wasnt love, I just thought youd fuck with me
Who couldve predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags want to cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And Ill never forget it, baby, what an experience
You couldve been the one but it wasnt that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I shouldve looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks

Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh
Everythings the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And hes still got his foot out, guilt tripping
Its been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now shes saying shes more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
Im flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Lets stay together til were ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
Thats why Im really going off, fireworks
When I go off like July 4
Feels like a fire, gotta go higher
 revelation, my sweet celebration
Ride me like a rocket
Cause cant nothin stop it
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks

Cut the lights , paid the price

Pass this to my daughter, Ima show her what it took 
Baby mama cover Forbes, got these other  shook

And nothings new but the shoes
What it do, what it do
And nothings new but the shoes
What it do, what it do
Cash rules everything around me 
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill yall
Knowledge of the Kingdom for a minute, but Im so gone
The world wrapped around my throat saying hold on
And I cant breathe, this pain wont leave
Trying get it together on my own the slow 
Thoughts so calm
Mastermind of consciousness
Master with a plan or disaster is the consequence
The Benz polished short sight and not confidence
With the faith of a mustard tree, we move continents
Made marvellous, results of a God who thought of us
The same God became a martyr to harbour us
Cold hands in this blood stained promise
The only Man who kept a hundred percent when He promised us
Peace
And a release from the harmfulness
Imagine that heaven only charmed and had come to us
Maybe its the only thing that belongs to us
Maybe we havent belonged long enough
Maybe we let sin become a part of us
Maybe we need life water just to wash us up
Not a doubt in my mind that water isnt strong enough
I tried
This evil in my soul is too hard to scrub
Cash rules everything around me 
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill yall
I wouldnt sell my soul for it all
The cash, the gold, the Rolex, the sex
The lust, the pleasure, the million dollar check
I wouldnt sell my soul for it all
Knowledge of the Kingdom but Im stuck
So hard to move off my hands I was trying to harm this fool
If you thought Im upset I bond to this carnival
And alarm dont worry my struggles arent hard to you
Why do I question Gods love like its so hard to prove
Know you only exist cause God thought of you
Now figure that, its hard to do
Go and try can I promise you its hard to do
Every mistake that we make its still starting to
And Im the one that did it, its almost like I saw Tucson bleeding ruse
No justice that a song could do
But the moment He looked at me I saw the truth
Some of us just sell amount to put on some jewels
Pharmaceutical dreams of being rich
No one can lose, small pursue
Occupied mind made for larger moves
Im tryna live, Imma follow ones for two
Cash rules everything around me 
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill yall 
These snakes always seem to be close to me
It seems that I must treat the ones that mean the most to me
And when this Egyptian touches my chest Im feeling so outta breath
My conscience wont let me rest
Im exhausted
Me and Louis V., taking jewellery, move outta and we zoning from the purest keys
Technically a branch, call me palm trees
Simple rose aint white linen its south beach
Red carpet up but I keep a hood reach
Hood bleeding so I cleaned it with the good bleach
And every industry rapper we yell preach
They only spit truth right, beep please
Man we talk about the cake
Sierra mist with the jelly on the bass
Got a sweet tooth stir it up and then bake
Give you type two, cold body with the shakes
I aint frontin B
And you can never have enough of it
 or rich, equatorial or obelisk, got a certain lust for this
Talking Grandino
Grant got me blessing, Franklin off the ego
Room so free-o
Chains got me starring out the peep hole
Schizophrenic, but I keep it on the d-low
, dont tell them what we know
Moneys the route of all evil, amigo
Cake it, cake it
I got the couple unmuted, I hid in my trunk
Hid in a coffin Im housing it up
The strippers they throwing it up
God over money, Im burning it up
Every young rapper we change in the game
Dorian Grey, youll be hearing my name
Lion-hearts everywhere no we aint lame 
Church and now Im shaking my mane
Spirit domain
Glory to God in the highest, giving Him all of the praise
Prolly aint nothing but plates
I wouldnt be massin the route with Jesus name
 no matter how much you all make
No celebration like who ate the cake
Winners so said it so what you do with Jesus Christ the only thing that will remain
What they saying, cake, cake, cake
They said they cake, they said they cake, they said they cake
Cake, cake, cake
I heard em say cake
They say the cake
They say the cake
They worry bout that cake
They focused on that cake
Oh oh
I aint worry bout that
I tell them I
Burn it up
Tell em that I burn it up
Take that money and I burn it up
Money and I burn it up
Take that money and I burn it up

Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me Im ready
If you ask me Im ready
Golden skies....Golden Streets... Golden Lives....
None of it compares to the look I see in her eyes....
Her Angel Wings Carried me from prior demise...
City of God who woulda thought I coulda made it riiight?

Loving the afterlife gotta say its type wild...
MLK Malcolm Billie Holiday..
Left Eye Big L Pac and MJ
We all kicking it no time limits on our day
No stress we blessed we saw Gods face........
This can be you if you not scared to make a way...
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
Its becoming something thats impossible to ignore
And I cant take it
Dont ever be afraid... to achieve the unthinkable...

You wont feel me til everybody say they love you
But its not love, bring it down an octave
Cause youre just another kid that the crew can get rid of
They say be quiet and stay silent
But you just staying loud, keeping proud
Cause you were taught that they were born to listen
And that you were born to fix up all the broken niggas
Bitching on the second level
Who are you to try? These niggas lost their lives?
Well, I just thought Id offer one
You wont feel me till one of your ex girls gets knocked up
She says she took a step but he took it further
Thinks he aint mean to hurt her, she says shes certain
But now its been a month, so now she has her doubts
Yeah she has her doubts and you have your doubts
Cause you warned her bout the route shes taking
See you always have advice, so you always giving
But they dont ever listen, they just pat you on your back
And say they feel you, nigga
Ive been fading too long
Ive been fading too long
Why wont it stop? The ride
Why wont it stop? The ride
You wont feel me til youre at your mothers funeral
And youre the only one not crying
Cause you cant get it through your head that she passed on
Yeah, shes really gone, no, shes really gone
But you just dont believe it, you think they got it wrong
You wont know me till your friends
Start laughing at you like some damn Hyenas
Reminds you of Selena back in eighth grade
When she said that, Youre doing wrong,
That, You need to change
Life is not a fairy tale, it aint no fucking game.
Youre gonna hate me, I swear, youre gonna hate me
When you catch kids sipping Pinnacle during missionary
Meanwhile, you bringing dead energy to a cemetary
Searching for your mothers grave
Crying yourself to sleep at night, cause you aint got it right
You aint even write a letter to say bye or nothing like
Your Dad fucking hates you, Mamas outta songs
Grandpa pays the bills and you always feel alone
So, Whats good at home? Whats good at home?
If you keep on X and Oing, keep on telling lies cuz
I feel you, nigga, I feel you
Whats good at home? Whats good at home?
If you keep on X and Oing, keep on telling lies cuz
I feel you, nigga, I feel you
Yeah, yeah—I feel you
Yeah, yeah—I feel you
Yeah, yeah—I feel you
Feel the moment
But think what youve forgotten
God and gotten rotten 
Just remembered a thought or two about it
You aint bout it
If only youd allow it 
Louder, scream it louder
I cant hear you! Louder!
Been an hour, Im an hour clerk
I just watch the time fly by
Sitting in my math class, man I hate class

Envelopes comin in the mail, let her open em
Hopin for a check again, aint no tellin
She invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, aint no tellin

Mixtape, I been working on this mixtape
Nigga if you been sleeping on me, thats a mistake
Just think, I been doing this since 6th grade
Back when all my Jay-Z covers only got like 6 plays
Did that satire shit and got on Renegade with J
Got on Rap Genius, then I did them verses with Sway
Now everybody telling me that all my shits great
Im like thanks but I think that yall a bit late
Aye, but at least now they seeing me
You officially listening to V.E.N.D
When it comes to MP3s, Im the MVP
Nah its all about me, Im the TimVP
Man, Im just rapping for respect, you know I gotta get it
Flexing on the track just like a nigga ate a lot of spinach
Did you get that last line? Man yall prolly didnt
Yall niggas still aint get like half the lines in no competition, nah
Envelopes comin in the mail, let her open em
Hopin for a check again, aint no tellin

Want a lot, will I get it all? Aint no tellin
No tellin, yeah, aint no tellin
No tellin, aint no tellin
Okay I had to switch the
Flow up on you niggas, shit was getting to predictable
Painting a picture with these words, the flow is visible
And if that is the case, then these aint verses, they visuals
Now picture this, Im not tryna get all deep and visceral
And you might find these theory to be completely dismissible
But how can you follow a crowd and be an individual?
Thats oxymoronic, like the homeless performing rituals
It dont add up, so you niggas will never get the sum
If you cant see this star in the making, youll never get the sun
If you cant see this war that Im waging, then its already won
Yall never been inspiring, believe me, this shits already done
I just named 4 Crash songs, and you aint even know it
All these niggas tryna save the game, they tryna be heroic
Im just proving that ya boy can spit, and that you need to know it
But after this song, I dont really think that I need to show it, nah
Envelopes comin in the mail, let her open em

Want a lot, will I get it all? Aint no tellin
They told me all of my lyrics are never ever fly
They told that I suck and that I should never try
They said Virtual Entertainment Never Dies
All the songs are free cause its shit that no one would ever buy
Whole time I was like, okay whatever guys
All that negative bullshit, I set aside
Cause it turns out that them niggas were never right
Cause this verse is so much better than anything theyll ever write
If you a pest to me then consider this verse some pesticide
If they say that Im wack, its just some lies, Im the best alive
Anyone wanna come prove me wrong? Then I suggest you try
Anyone wanna come at me wrong? Then I suggest you hide
With this tape, you know its safe to say the best has just arrived
I bet you guys get petrified every time that I testify
The best is I, and its about time I start getting recognized
When I meet Mr. West some time, thats when two of the best collide
I really hate to be this guy
But I think Id rather be seen alive, than sing a lie
Nowadays, the real nigga get penalized
If they not rapping bout trapping more than a venus fly
You know I really hate to be this guy
But who says the limit has to be the sky?
Thats a mentality that should be despised
Cause Im out of this world, so that saying should really be revised
My talent will never be disguised, so you cant be surprised
If you niggas still cant see my rise, get some eagle eyes
Fuck how horribly this entire mixtape is equalized
Im not tryna get on the radio, Im tryna Ether guys
D.E.A.D. Entertainment, we on top, and you cant beat the guys
The clique is Susan Storm-Richards, you cant even see the guys
Rolling with the cheese and the dough, like the pizza guys
Came to give the game a spark, Im feeling like Im Lisa, guys
Im going in, but I gotta save, I got 7 tracks left
Will them bitches be any good? Aint no tellin
Mixed this whole fucking thing by myself
Will these verses sound like they should? Aint no tellin
Police comin round lookin for some help
On a case they gotta solve, but we never help em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Aint no tellin

Not sooner or later, but sooner than later
Born in September, I say it proudly

Purple spright poured in my stirophoame cup
Mama praying for me, hoping that I slow up
But I proceed to act an animal

Im just tryna reach my peek, nigga feel me
And lord knows most of the shit I love 
But Ill proceed to keep going until Im filthy
Cause one of my niggas just faced the judge and found guilty
So Imma spread my wings, and Imma keep flying

Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo

Yeah...
I just kind of feel like...
I just need to -- get this off my chest
People always waiting on you to take the first step
Cause theyre afraid of the pain of drowning in disappointment
When thats the price of success
Its a shame, its a shame
The rap game will never be the same, be the same
The world is getting colder
And Im just getting older
Cross paths with old friends
But I just change lanes
When people look at you like, Its a bird. Its a plane.
They stand up on your shoulders and the view is insane
Empire state of mind
Im running out of patience
Im running out of time
Its no wonder that my rhymes are terminally ill...
Sick is underrated
Unlucky 13
And Im the Dr. Foreman
Headed to my Dr. House
Just to get some Dr. Cuddy
And a new IV;
Infinite Vocabulary
Whats its like to be a woman?
No Tyler Perry
Not that Im a fag, but I ask
Cause relationships are difficult
And women get sensitive to the 10th power
Starting from the day a nigga pop her cherry
But thats just my opinion right?
And opinions are just feelings right?
I guess I just like to view opinions
As events without a witness
So rewind this, just to make sure that you hear it right
Fuck that nigga you with baby, you know I can hit it right
But I know I got a girl
See this the type of shit be going on in my mind
And its heavy on my mind
Like my brains in the gym
And my Frontal Lobe, is on a 1,000 Pound Curl like…
Like... Wait... Wait
My imaginations kinda scary
Bare with me for a minute please
I put my feelings in the grave where my soul buried
God dont you see me on my knees?
Please save me from my nightmares
I just wanna live my dreams
But I dont wanna play for fun
I would rather play for keeps…
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air

Order more drinks from the bar, thats basic
Ten bottles of champagne, I ace it
Baby so horny, and Im so wasted
Patron shots but I still cant taste it
Gucci Mane the shit, punk boy just face it
Woke up home, dont know how I made it
Walked in the club and the club got crazy
Told the DJ, Hey lets get faded
Higher than a white boy, Im Slim Shady
Dancin on the dance floor with your old lady
Maybach benz, Can I fit em in? Maybe
Drownin in Don Piece, someone save me
Bricksquads a army, no were the navy
Im a kush smoker, I blow kush daily
Hunnid dollar haircut, my temp fade wavy

Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
Oh Ive been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I’ve been drinking so much
That Ima call her anyway, and say…
Forget that new guy that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say forget that new guy that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know hes not around
I’m just sayin you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
Im just sayin you could do better
And Ill start hatin only if you make me
Cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she dont have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doin that’s so important?
I’ve been drinkin so much
That I’ma call you anyway, and say…
Forget that new guy that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say forget that new guy that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know hes not around
Im just sayin you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I’m just sayin you could do better
I think Im addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking bout bitches that we almost had
I dont think Im conscious of makin monsters
Outta the women I sponsor til it all goes bad
But, shit, its all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, ‘cause they were just leavin
Talk to me, please, dont have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women thats livin off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, Im ashamed
Bet that you know them, I wont say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
Ive had sex four times this week; Ill explain
Im havin a hard time adjustin to fame
Sprite in that mixture
Ive been talkin crazy, girl, Im lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
Im just sayin you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
Im just sayin you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
Im just sayin you could do better
Im just sayin you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?

Before they announced my name you had the whole crowd seated
And Rich aint show up so now you get that show out treatment
Your opponent couldnt cross the border: aint that sweet?
So now them URL bars you got is aimed at me?
I hopped a flight last-minute soon as they paid that fee
I boarded but it was Pro choice to take Plan B
Man it sucks that battle didnt work out, cause shit is gettin worse now
You bout to feel that same fire that brought the Hindenberg down
You aint battlin Rich Dolarz no more, but after I spit this first round
I bet $100,000 you gon wish you were now
Ninja focus, you get checked with something extra like a Christmas bonus
I dont pick opponents, I hunt and kill them in the moment
Took this shit on 20 minutes notice
Ive been the coldest, if I hit him, Pro gets stapled down the middle like a centerfold is
When in Rome, you gettin thrown in the arena
Lookin like a Mexican Ice-T, Corona and Tequila
Peep the gold gloves: Midas Touch
E.T., light him up
Get beat by an iron club like the Ryder Cup
I tried to warn him, youre no match for me, Pro
Its no accident
Ill run you over on both fields on some Bo Jackson shit!
Dont ask for this
Im not someone to throw hands against
Tryin to play hero will only get Pro tagged in this 
Closed-casket bitch, you know Im brick-solid
Howd you go from Rich Dolarz to the ghost of Chris Wallace?
Im nice!
So this is the replacement for Rich Dolarz?
A quick combo will open you up like a gym locker
Ill beat you til my hands more bloody than Stigmata
Til a bone is poppin out of your nose like a witchdoctor
You got more holes in your face than a hockey mask
If looks like you and Freddy Kruger had a boxing match
Im glad you replaced Rich, Id have dropped his ass
And tossed Dolarz around this stage like its pocket cash
Im the core revolutionary that ran through em
A brown beret in the drivers seat lampooning
A Black Panther in the shotgun; Cam Newton
Clap through him, Rasputin
Yall saw what I did to Bulletz, I turned this bitch to a mass shootin
Now Im back, I get love from these Toronto fans
I know you like to gamble Pete but this is not yo hand
Check the name on the venue, I go HAM
I got the Queen Elizabeth goin crazy, Im the Macho Man
Ooooh yeaaaah! Son Im a Savage
How yall replace him for Rich? Money is average
Youre an average Joe
You battled Illmac and tried to leave your man exposed
But he killed you, we saw the box on stage like a magic show
Then Deadman put you in a casket closed
You always been a shaky-ass performer: Amber Rose
Your fat jiggles when you rap in each direction
Walkin around in real life lookin like youre in three dimensions
Mexicans roll deep, you better seek protection
My cartel in the streets like I need directions
Wheres your career headed, Pete? Its been six years since your best battle
Youre barely enhancin
Youre still tryin to top yourself: Marilyn Manson
You were the man in the freestyle era, you were livin the dream
But battle rap changed and you dont fit in the scene
You aint Lebron James, this is your king?
You more like Malone, Stockton, youll never win in the ring
Mr. Two Time Everything, the old champs back
Now excuse him while he gives himself a Pat on the back
Charrons tramp stamp
It took a while to react, they still dont get it
Howd you birth a thousand battlers and still look pregnant?
Yo, that one bar you said about Mexicans was subpar
Cause yeah, yall do roll deep, but all of you are in one car
This was supposed to be your big moment homie, breathe it in a bit
Cause now they got you battlin me, reconsider it
I got it sewn, no need to stick a needle into it
How fitting, Randy Savage in a ring at Queen Elizabeth
Most people need two months for this shit, give me a week
Ill waste the first six days writin my victory speech
Your chicky? She been itchin to get this mystery meat
So I passed that piece pipe like an Indian chief
You bringin me beef? Fuck it, its smack down time
Rooftop, when I say jump dont ask, How high?
You said youd body Blackout 5, you flat out lied
Cause Im the winner so cold you think you back outside
This sounds fine, who else could do this on one days prep?
Show interest, then its settled like an unpaid debt
Im headline worthy you aint made a front page yet
So is me replacing Rich Dolarz an upgrade? YES!
I just aint stressed about this little goof
Im still the truth, you little fuckin pygmy, you
Look up at me when Im killin you!
If he loses, no matter where he go he get laughed at
And if he wins? Fuck it, Rey Mysterio gets his mask back
Yo, you revolutionized battle rap? Pete miss me
Your only revolution was goin through 180 to 360
Yo Peter Morris, when did you eat The Saurus?
Hes enormous, how do your feet support this? Youre a freakin walrus
Back stabbin your best friend was your peak performance
You battled Illmac that was 09, must be a slow grind
Cause its 2015 and you been wack....this whole time
I mean look at Dumbfoundead, Dizaster, even Soul Khan
Then look at Pete doin Soul Khans slogan just tryin to hold on...hold on...hold on!
You still tryin to hold to battle rap bro....oh my God
Peter Morris is in my face I cant believe this
(chokes and then freestyles)
Fuck it, we gon get through the rest of the round
Just tryin to show yall how we freestyle we gettin this now
It was Blackout 5, let me blackout live
You said youre so fuckin cold Id be back outside
It doesnt really matter, I freestyle best on the market
Youre wearin that fuckin sweater so we can tell who the mark is
Cousin, bust it, ooooh come on!
Youre still tryin to hold on to battle rap? You should reexamine your life
Youre fuckin with a Pro this aint amateur night
Tell your dogs I kill cats when I handle the mic
I came to put an end to Peter with these animal rights
And I hope you came to punch back
Cause Arsonal said hed smack your daughter with his nut rag and you just stood there like, Ho ho ho. Man I love that.
Dont react while Im killin you, even through a choke, I dont want that
Youre the most embarrassing thing in battle rap since Chris Unbiass mustache
Get out of them Facebook groups, where you diss the fans
You talk more shit to Stans than Vince McMahon
Yeah I overuse similes, I tip my hand
I drop more likes than Hitman Hollas Instagram
Fake follwers
But I dont need a brother to hold me up, ampin the crowd
I dont got a gun so big I gotta drag it around
I got 30 pages of rhymes to make you crash through the crowds
And have the whole crowd lookin like Christian 818 durin Canibus rounds
Dude I got through a choke its awfully goofy
Im who you C.O.D. its my Call Of Duty
Be honest pussy, Ill rock your kufi
Youve been put in the air by more battlers than Bonnies booty
Everybody on this card beat him
You lost to 100 Bulletz bro?
 No
 Yes you did. You lost to him in the UK
 I didnt
 Fuckin liar
 Indecisive
 Bullshit
 He spit Pokemon bars
Last year I caught a body for sure
I gave him punch after punch; Gotti and Ward
I had him makin excuses, soon as he walked through the door
Bulletz was hangin onto his chest like a Somalian war
You lose a lot, I maneuver plots
Ill kill you with the cool side of the pillow, word to Stuart Scott
You were hot, in the WRCs but your future flopped
You get more ass every year thats a booty shot
First off I can freestyle way better than you dawg
Off top, Sports Center; one shot: BOOYAH!
And now Im bout to dead it son
You got 30 pages of rhymes up in this motherfucker? Thank God you finally remembered one
Yeah you heard it son, it aint until this verse is done
Where the fuck yall think lil Charron learned it from?
They say a good defense is the best offense
Id say you were best off tossin the towel at the press conference
Next topic: when you stretch bars I get nausious
Left cross, you bring out the worst in me like sweat lodges
So just stop it, off top yo this scenes not scripted
Ironic, I hit J and he got lifted
Two pumps and aint a pair of Reeboks with it
Watch Pete coach Pro, no Seahawks tickets
Now this shit? Homie this shit, its backhanded time
Fuck what Pro has in store I cant stand the line
Fuck what J has in store yo I cant stand the line
Now you gettin flattened by me I guess its over buddy
Im bout to...break your fuckin face and now you owe me money
That was from the last event, Ima come up and snap your neck
This is me, the fuckin main speaker here, catchin wreck
Now if I passed away tomorrow...I think the whole world-it would probably shut the world down
Wait, but if J-Pro died tomorrow theyd be like, Fuck. Whos gonna work the door now?
Time
FUCK!
Yo man its alright, we both did it
 I did it because of you. You inspired me
 Were in this together dude
 We are. It was a team effort
 Yo! Back to being a dickhead
 True. True
I heard Uno boned your ex, banged her for weeks
Did her worse than Mystique then shovel danced in your sheets
Then I heard you guys ran train, I guess Peter is right
You two time everything, even your wife
Im so deadly, two can same result; Coke/Pepsi
You get exed out and stay thirsty; Dos Equis
I saw you get killed by Dan, dont test me
You let that man go nuts in your face; Loe Pesci
You traveled all that flight distance and Im glad you made it
Cause as soon as they turn that FilmOn we seen that Rich bitch fuckin up more battles than Alki David
You seen that footage; Lush wrestling Alki
Ran up on him, then grabbed his neck in the lobby
This wouldve been similar to that, Id be catchin a body
Cause that Rich fool be chokin in the ring more than Ted Diabiase
Yeah I brought bars about wrestlin moves
Youre the fuckin man for tryin to step in his shoes
But now I gotta leave you dead, youll be left in a tomb
Jimmy Fallon Show, leave him next to The Roots
Kick him a couple times, like, Yeah thats a real body
I dont feel this pussy; Charron when he drills Tarsi
I know your real hobbies, playing online poker and beer pong with Bill Cosby
First punch, put him in a daze, thats Rico
Second punch, put him back in a daze ; thats Skee-Lo
Third punch, death ridin beside him, thats evil
Fourth punch, theyll be ridin together Mac Lethal
That BOLA shit, right?
He hit me like, Pro its last minute are we riding together?
I was like, From the airport? He was like, Nah, literally writing together?
Fuck that Im applying the pressure
This is Petes peril, a last second call got you picked off; Pete Carrel
Hes like, Yo when you see Hawks  you blaze nada
How did yall expect a gambling addict to save Dolarz?
I know youre in Las Vegas, playin your little cards
And late night The Saurus goes to underage titty bars
 Do those exist in Vegas?
Hes like, Do those exist? Man that isnt real
But then he turns into Loaded Lux when he gets caught, I just had to get the feel
Im just freestylin
You should be on Loaded Lux level, I mean The Saurus old
He was battlin since cave painting in Morse code
You can tell a The Saurus fan from they wardrobe
Cause only computer geeks think Saurus cold 
Hes like, Scribble Jam! Scribble Jam! We freestyled it was raw its impossible!

I dont know how to talk to you
I dont know how to ask you if youre okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like theyre just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I dont know how to talk to you
I dont know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just dont understand it
Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just dont understand it
I dont know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I cant get across to you
Yeah and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just dont understand it
Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just dont understand it
Years go by so fast
I cant keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It cant end like this 
Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just dont understand it
Im too good to you
Im way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just dont understand it
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin up on my old ways
I cant blame you, no

My heart it melts like plastic
I fell through the hole yesterday
Your smile pulled me in like elastic
I felt my mind detonate
Oh, Ive made mistakes

Your world was to me, so fantastic
And help seemed so far away, far away
When Im crying out for change
You tell me its just growing pains
Oh, Ive made mistakes

You gon break it if you dont downshift
And I know you get a rush when you hang around risk
But you gon get enough when you breakin down sick
All ill cant move your wheels and feelin like shh
Just a mile back you was feelin quite brisk
Now you sittin on bricks, wit ya car on strict
Radio gone, insurance wont cover
Paint job wreck and you draggin your muffler
Wouldnt listen then, but I bet you hear now
Cuz you gotta speed ticket cuz you wouldnt slow down
Yeeeah
Monster
How should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
Monster
How should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I aint nothin to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Whod have thought a countrywide tourd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, Im about my business
Killin all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin for forgiveness
If you aint been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
Monster
How should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
Okay, hello, its the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess Im just New Orleans
And I will never stop like Im runnin from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, To the top
Life is such a fuckin roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you dont wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, thats what they gotta say or mention
Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer
Im restin in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foots sleepin on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last
Monster
How should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
Monster
How should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
There they go, packin stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
Hes wonderin if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He aint had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo
Bashin in the brains of these hoes
And establishin a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You cant put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That Im talkin about when we riot
You dealin with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, hows it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
Im Hannibal Lecter, so just in case youre thinkin of savin face
You aint gonna have no face to save
By the time Im through with this place, so Drake

See it used to be a struggle
Since we made it safe from our seats will unbuckle
In our heads we would worry about trouble
Like how would me make it chest deep beneath the rubble
And now we look down on it like hubble
All the haters start to mumble because we scored they fumbled
And now we just sit and chill
As we count the countless bills and we realize this is real
Were at the top to this game you jack and jilled
Never pay for shit again always have free refills
Never plain on breaking so there is no plan for rebuild
Wish i could keep this feeling forever thats how we feel
So if youre wondering if well be fine its yes
And if my crew is down you aint even gotta guess
You know i love my lifestyle so you think im blessed
Being at the top is perfect because theres no more stress
Im trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you aint even gotta ask
Because its hard to say no
Yea its hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea youre all the way down every time
Am i down am i down
Yea Im all the way down well be fine
Im fine were fine but yes of course we murder time
This beats a corpse in the back of the room thats mine
Mess with you because youre dumb and were just having fun
Dreams of making millions thats paper to the cieling
And i aint saying we the shit but if you gotta
Then let them know to hit the road we taking over shows
And like a penalty i got red flags
In the sky in disguise my boys ride
I would look outside if you feel somebodys watching
Tick tock im knocking clocks in man screw a clock in
This the team and you could say we do it often
Zay Drizzy and Jerz we get it poppin
You can call me superman with an S upon my chest
Never give rappers chances because Im always at my best
I keep the comp worried like game set and match
And they wonder how they get out like wheres the escape hatch
Drake already said that well be fine
No more take out for us we wine and dine
Never dull moments when living express line
Now watch us do our thing no need for stars aligned
Im trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you aint even gotta ask
Because its hard to say no
Yea its hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea youre all the way down every time
Am i down am i down
Yea Im all the way down well be fine
Well be fine got my fam and my homies
Whats the time gotta make sure my girl aint lonely
Oh but i gotta remind dont forget that we the only
Greatest ones in this last year in this cuz
We be getting rich cant even make a wish
Man i swear its like we run these kids we be throwing back our lids
What we say is what we do even if it is
Something thats too cold for you because we dont care if you freeze in this
Im trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you aint even gotta ask
Because its hard to say no
Yea its hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea youre all the way down every time
Am i down am i down

Null ist das Tor in eine andere Welt
Uns egal, was allen anderen gefallt
Wir sind der singende und tanzende Abschaum der Welt
Jeder hat kaum noch Geld
Doch wir sind trotzdem drei mal so voll wie unser Kuhlschrank
Und wir leuchten heller als der Rest mit ausgeglichenem Gemutszustand
Schlieb die Augen, fuhlst du es dann?
Wie du die Mudigkeit ubermannst?
Die Fube im Sand, der Kopf im Smog
Obgleich du dachtest Null wird mein bestes Album, doch, wer weib?
Ich gebe mein Talent den Hunden zum Frab
Es langweilt sie, sie haben Zeit Ihres Lebens daran rumgenagt
Wenn ich mir den Kopf wegschieb, wachsen zwei neue nach
Ich feier meinen Erfolg im Grab
Zeit, dass ich weniger sag
Ich bin nicht Maeckes, nur sein chinesisches Plagiat
NULL!
 

Dry! ...Me a desert him
Nuh time to have you lurking
Him ah go act like he nuh like it
You know I dealt with you the nicest
Nuh body touch me you nuh righteous
Nuh badda, text me in a crisis
I believed all of your dreams, adoration
You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that youve never seen
Something that youve never been!

No Im not racist white girls in my cabin so i make it rain on them throwing cheese on them crackers. 
(HOOK)
Im about to blow you already blew it, oh you didnt know you probably never knew it
Silly girls going dumb acting hell of stupid usually she dont but she will if i let her do it
Oops! that was out of line but i dont apologize if i say sorry a thousand times it would all still be all a lie
I dont want to take that route to rhyme so my own road Im bout to drive it my turn hard grind hit a verse now its mine
Yea its me Killa i began the ball game but i aint playing got em gone from the fall game and this means i started with an art frame
I filled it with my art that was drawn out in hard paint so if you thinking that Im soft let that thought change
Im a rip ya mind tissue leave you with a scarred brain heard truth hurts so i do worst harsh pain
Bust another feel the hit when my heart BANG! witnessing the pain i cause now have to hurt scene
And if the judge hit you i know that will hurt eternally making the twatty new listeners act like they heard of me
They want to play a part in my actual currency but thats funny so Im laughing for certainly
Because you never even know the half what its worth to me i do it for the love Im not rapping to work for free
And everywhere its taken me at i deserve to be

How Im feeling, it doesnt matter
Cause you know Im okay
And still, I ask myself, Why do you worry?
When you know Im the same
I know, I know you dont love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club 
Fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays its six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I dont know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes Im bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you aint the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but Im just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if Ill be going platinum in a year again?
Dont I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Dont Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I dont ever be trippin off of what aint mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah...Its been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I aint even notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
You say Im old news, well who the new star?
Cause if Im going anywhere, its probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brothers case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas thats doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when its bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think its their time
Yeah, dont make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Dont make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah.. its whatever
You know, feeling good - living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, Im back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like Ive been here before, huh?
I still got 10 years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Lets toast to the fact that I moved out my mama basement
To a condo downtown, cause its all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch californication of life
You shouldve been here to kick it with me
We couldve split this whole thing up 50/50
But now Im at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killin shit, they ever so talented as the Ripley
How I go from being a man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter puttin out the hardest shit?
I should want to go back to the one I started with
But Im addicted to this life, its gon be hard to quit, yeah

Look
Turned this to an organization
Used to have bashments down in the basement
Look in the ceiling, pink foam insulation
Now we just link up for corporate occasions
Say she been fuckin with me since the Hazelton
If I dont like how hes movin, Im pagin him
Hear that they dissin, back then, I was raisin em
Niggas is in for the rudest awakenin
Walls are so tall, I don’t know who my neighbor is
Baka, my crodie, his songs are amazing
But I knew that nigga when he wasnt makin em
Yeah
Turned this to a organization
Rap-A-Lot Mob, we tied up like laces
Bank in Bahamas, you know Im evasive
I got my money in ten different places
GME, B.O.B., joint operations
If its a problem, Im droppin location
Or I send Kayla, shes very persuasive
Brr
Si ven dosciento en un corillo en Santurce, son los puto Illuminati
Con tanto palos que si no te la agarro, los cambiamo por un Bugatti 
Me llaman mariachi, va a coger tiro hasta John Gotti 
El Draco e negro y color rojo 
Y to el mundo sabe que lo matamo nosotro
Y hay tanto poder que ningun huelebicho ha choteao 
El tambor se le prendio

Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Muthafuck them other niggas be the state of mind
Got them haters on the job like it’s a 9 to 5
Getting money, mind ya business and stay out of mine
50 thousands for this rolly homie
I die tonight just bring my jewelry to the ceremony
Lord knows I be shittin’ on ‘em
Hottest nigga since that weather out in Arizona
Sleeping on me hope you choke and fall into a coma
Smell the frangrance know the money be the new aroma
I’m just spazzing out, denims carry large amounts
Got them bitches throwin’ pussy what the asses out
True story, new glory
Money stacking taller than a two story
Real niggas countin money, never gets boring
Last year I made a million of the state touring
Fuck boys, know what you talking bout
I run my own team, aint no room for mascots
Look around, peep at the winners circle
We the niggas touching paper like a social worker
Plus them pistols keep them shells like a ninja turtle
Wear rubber, cus these Spanish bitches so fertile
Lord Knows I be going hard
RIP my nigga Daniel, remember that garage
Long nights, before that rap shit
I was thinking moving keys like a locksmith
No sir, the cops
Them crackers dirty, I just hope you keep ya name clear
Waiting for a nigga, trippin’ I just stand still
I aint trippin’ I just stand still
Lord knows that I’m stressed out
Walking through these roadblocks with my chest out
Damn, 23 and made a million dollars
Fucking put a quarter million dollars round a collar
Couple more to cop a Phantom I aint talking opera
They sya my flow sick I should see a fucking doctor
Real niggas in ya presence
Chopper raise a nigga head like you present
Broward County I am that
Only nigga in my city riding Maybach’s
Motivation, motivation, my niggas fans are dead
They only location?
And thats word to my daughter
I’m just tryna make it your headquarters

Only videos connect me to Phamous people
And had dreams that one day Ill be these people
Passion so great, equate that to Kanyes Ego
Let me take a break, Hi fam I miss you people
From humble beginnings like Christ in a manger
We looking out to being everywhere Power Ranger
Just like Guinness, greatness been my nature
Call this my Pep Talk but Im no Guardiola
Ha!
If only wishes were horses, Ill be riding on that POLO like Ralph Lauren
Then I just flourish, move from dawn to morning
Always fly, that nigga Pope is so flawless
I Ball like J, and I aint talking Jordan
Sing my heritage something like Morgan
Flow on keys, make you feel it in your organs
Bars bigger than the arms of Hulk, Hogan
But Ill be waiting for my moment
Show love to my thugs and single women
Even if all you see around is bad omen
Keep pushing till you see the light up, fulfilment
What you waiting dude, see what we came through?
Member we been on this move, since our A moon
Now you believe me if I say dreams do come true
Used to love Rumor, Kendrick, Lu and Nas too
Now see weytin this guy do
Making critics go sick with the attitude
I should be in Yeezys clique cos Im so GOOD
Yo Drizzy hook me up, beat is so full soulful
Who wouldve thought Id be caught in this life?
Lets celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up 
Wait until the sun goes down, we gon make this
Bitch light up 
Even when the sun goes down Im a make it go
 Who wouldve thought that from the background
Ill be the same person now leading in the front-line
Michael Jackson vision though I never back-slide
Now e be like say I get chaw Goodluck pass Jonathan
So Be4 we shine, word to Kojo-Cue
Have dreams of doing things they say that you cant do
Me and my success book an appointment, No rendezvous
I See Notorious in my mirror, get that Bigger view
Lets Roll-on charley, now thats a Sure Thing
Now my success is guaranteed like its a LeBron Ring
Money in my youth is like Y so Im yearning 
Lessons in our lives are like stripes that we earning 
If you dey hustle for real show your light up
Just say, I can be the answer
Not a Nissan, but Christ a Pathfinder
And be ever-ready to beat the odds, u a Punter 
Money makers, now see what money made us
Partying every night, now I look kinda faded
Drinks up in the air, lets toast to these haters
Imma Tell u like Drake told me, bye TAKE CARE!!!

Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean

Tripping off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumours, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me

Was playing dumb for fun, bitch I’m college educated
Always shot my shot, hoe and I never hesitated
Drinking every night cuz my days suck
Was FaceTiming ugly hoes just to meet and face fuck
Now baddies hit my line they wanna taste luck
Hoe, I came from the bottom, had to raise up
Started from the bottom now I’m here, hoe
Now I’m at the top and you boutta get an earful
Started from the bottom now I’m here, hoe
Be careful, I’m coming for yo heads, best be fearful

Baddies put it on me, mad booty you hoes owe me
No softies in my pose baby, hard niggas only

Notified the homies to meet at Berwick
Now youre completing shots, now them homies got you launched up
Dont know who youre chatting bout Ill set that on the Bible
Dissing and insulting me, dont make me diss you on songs
And you know
Think Im LeBron James, the way Im teed off 23 points
And you know pockets on whatever pants, forever blue
And you know, notified me lotta items but aint mention everything
But now I know, each single item there was plenty items I didnt know
Plenty items you didnt mention, was messin with you anyway
Was messin with you way before you had some admissions to create
You decide to collect samples for some songs, I know you gon collect samples
And you know 
Everyones a sinner
Im a sinner
Adam & Eve sipped juice from the forbidden fruit and got loose
They devoured the forbidden fruit and got loose
I put my faith in God
I worship God
God please repent me for all of my sins
Everyone sins
I praise the lord
I pray to God
Worshipping the lord
Praying to God
Rebuke all of the bad spirits
Rebuke all of the evil spirits
God is the creator of Earth
God created the planet Earth

Candy red, candy on the new bed
Versace spread, hundred where a nigga lay
Where we played, brought her on another site
Ocean city view, hella choppers every night
G-5, take her on another spree
Shopping spree, for fucking with a G
YM nigga, YMCMB
Everyday the lugshery life of an OG
Persion rugs, chandeliers on the marbel floor
Berkin bags, Chanel with the glass doors
V-12, 7-60 with the new money
New ghost white pearl, bitch, Young Money
Higher than I ever been
Ocean water, jetskies, Gucci Bens
Brand new photo Bens
And everytime I come, I got my 2 block twins
I said, oo girl, you classy
Oo, girl, you nasty
Type to never ever put no drugs where your ass be
Thats one of your best qualties, baby girl, if you ask me
You looking like a tough professor, its hard for you to pass
This Purp got me high, man, Im feelin like Phillis
Meditated murder, tonight Im tryna kill it
You saying you been doing your key glows, well tonight Im tryna feel it
Rest In Peace to Gary Colman
Dont need no translater to understand your body language
That ass must be part of the bloods, the way that bitch bangin
I aint no vocal coach, but Ill have that pussy sangin
You seeing stars and stripes, you hereing bells ringin
Now tell me your secret, as Im sliding off your Vickies
All blessings, dnt worry bout no quickies
We could get tipsy like some hippies, and Minaj like Nicki

Have it my way, them bullets coming for your ass lik tupe its the superbowl
What would you do if I needed more cash, What would you do if I needed a bus pass, would say Who me, get up and pay your fare is that you walking or is that the money talking

But now were just close and distant
Because I stepped out and went to your old assistant
Im sorry but she needed assistance
You know how I am Im so consistent
You know how Im so persistent
You should hear me out but that would require you to shut up and listen
New guy but you know something is missing
And the other day at your crib either we did or we didnt
You think you broke your commitment
Is he your man though? I mean either he is or he isnt
Or maybe Im tripping
You know that relationship is in shambles and
You left and had to break fast now you out here scrambling

We got tings I just cant change
Burn everything, oh
Burn everything
Glory in my eyes, this is the story of my life
And you’ll be sorry that you tried me
Youll be sorry that you lied and youll be sorry

Pisiyim yanimdadir, onunla eylenirem, gedib Birkin alacam ona
He, civi, barmagimdaki en ucuz uzuk de yuz min dollardir, woo
Muhitime salmaq ucun bir denesini ilk teyyareyle Ispaniyaya gonderdim, woo
Bir de, qiza Audemar aldim
uzuye uc min verdim, civi, bunun adi Bentley SUV-dur, woo

I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
Thats why you trust me
I know youve been through more than most of us
I graduated but didnt attend the ceremony
Because the honour wasnt really much to cherish for me
Imagine being on stage with teeth barely showing
Stomach in chest out, with the cameras glowing
For a qualification youll never glorify
More than getting excessive plays on Spotify
Or Soundcloud, around town they know the guy
The calling was too loud to nullify
A hundred times, I swear, I tried to deviate
And I was wishing that Modimo could just mediate
I broke down, no tow truck to see me straight
Psychologist saying that Im in need of space
But Im already lonely, though Im hardly alone
On a journey I shouldnt be embarking alone
Pack of 10s and a 6 pack I party alone
Say hello to the real me I promised to show
Hi, nice to meet you
Im hoping that we can connect as people
Im learning with time to silence my ego
But, being humble dont mean that I cant be lethal
Im killing you if I need to, Im killing you if I need to
Your honesty can sometimes lead me on to a sequel
Id probably be a nice guy if I wasnt so evil
Because Im vulnerable the most whenever Im living see through
Transparent its hurting like Im a homophobe
And fuck you to all the homophobes
My cousins the realest person Ive ever known
And he was living gorgeous way before they invented phones
So get a load of this reality
For all the tough times that you battle in
A little bounce you can party to
And heres the needed magic to get you through all your Varsy Blues
.. Yes
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
Thats why you trust me
I know youve been through more than most of us

I could tell you from experience
These bitches aint loyal
Shit aint been the same since
They treat me like Im Royal
Doing every female dirty
Cause I havent found the real one
She just wanna hang cause she never real fun
Like pimp c said this aint 91
Stopped working for a boss when I became one
You would think they feline these niggas acting pussy
You would think Im the edge they way they push me
I gotta keep real, cause fakeness aint me
You always keep it real, that what you promised me
If I told you that I trust you
Would you go and break my trust
If I told you that I love you
Would you go and fuck it up
I know you someones daughter
So Ima love you harder, girl
Faithful faithful faithful faithful
You always accusing me but girl I wouldnt cheat
I been in the Stu working hard so im never in the street
Especially cause you look like a model
Ima finish up this song and go cop a bottle
Take off your clothes off the henny I got no patience
She a skinny girl but her ass jiggle when she naked
She didnt let me hit quick but Im glad I waited
Fuck them other girls cause you my bitch and Im glad to say it
I was the most hated for a long time
By the females who couldnt be mine
Yeah
But they know you my boo
I would never have you looking like a fool
Cause thats impossible
She smart she go to school

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love, call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know that hotline bling
Oh, and that could only mean one thing
Well, and I know that hotline bling
Oh, and that could only mean one thing
Boy, what do you mean?
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you dont want me to leave, then you tell me to go
When you wanna turn right, when you wanna turn right
Cause we argue all day, makin love all night
Oh, what do you mean?
Oh, and where are you now? Oh
Hello from the other side
I mustve called a thousand times
To tell you Im sorry
For ever breaking your heart
But when I called, youd never seem to be home...
So, why dont you call me on my cell phone?
Late night when you need my love, just call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know that hotline bling
Oh, and that could only mean one thing
Well, and I know that hotline bling
Oh, and that could only mean one thing

Wouldve came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I cant let it go
Whether thats right I will never know
Hope you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I wouldve came back, but I wouldve came back for you
Wouldve came back, wouldve came back
Lil Mel :
Never on my mind to change
I just stay the same
See my life image is plain
Now addin a frame
Do what I want for me
Overlooking the rest
I just express the truth
And hope for the best
I was taught to be independent
So me standing alone is not really nothing new
Moms told me grow up and make the right variety in life
Now I guess it’s about time I choose
I would love to see the faces of those who tried
Cuz like a new car in highschool they wantin a ride
But No wasn’t with me then not with me now
I see how money sure make em come around
But for now that’s just a dream I’m just hoping for
I wish could step right into fame like an open door
I hate that it’s my fault women lose connection
But I never chase girls so there no real affection
Family over all I stand by that statement
Success is in the air I inhale the greatness
I tell them liers to get use to my lateness
They need to realize themselves to differ the from fakeness
I hate it
Also im way pass judgement calls
I’m not the one to judge
And neither are you
So don’t tell me what you hear
Tell me what you know
If you paid attention to my lyrics tell me what you owe
If I ask you my name do you even know
And if ya dnt know now ya kno
Lil Mel

Verse 1: Drake
...50 world and we live then, overtime we dine them

It started off with a round of applause
Cheers to my women who 
Who never been a heartbreaker, got a mind about it
Thought I had that, but I was wrong... lemme tell ya bout it
She was like my angel from way up above
She cried from the sky, she would shower me with love
Had her over every day, every single day I did
Started gettin careless, so next thing you know we made a kid
She was like mmm, I was like yess!
I hope we have a son, watch this nigga be the best
And right around june she took a plane & it was too late...
I did the math & found out her due date was...
In julyy. there were fireworks exploding
But now its getting colder. the leaves are turning colors
Ask me why. its just not our season
The one & only reason, ahhh
Uh, this starts as my snipers hit they marks
And ya guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like clap, clap... let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let em all go
And most women are motivated, so I act accordingly
But this is so eshing that it means a lil more to me
Dedicating time when I really cant afford to be
I provide protection if you open the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple I think that were readys, couple I think we should waits
Are we actin like a couple? Im just trynna get it straight
Cause Im over here convinced that its too early for mistakes & man...
Ohh, we had to change up the game
Oh, the weather is not the same
Now theres only cloudy days, I cant stand the rain
In julyy. there were fireworks exploding
But now its getting colder. the leaves are turning colors
Ask me why. its just not our season
The one & only reason, baby oh baby oh
Our summer turned into fall
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go?
I followed the rules & told ya everything ya had to know
Had ya over every night, every night was passionate
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident
Cause she was supposed to be my shawty, my baby
 this crazy
I put your life in front of mine because thats where you asked to be
Sayin I dont treat you the same, so now you askin me
Who cares chivarly, they need to get they sentencing
Meanwhile we arguin, & I cant get a sentence in
And just as I was hangin up the phone, she told me to hold on
Cause shes finally comin home in july...
In julyy. there were fireworks exploding
But now its getting colder
 the leaves are turning colors
Ask me why. its just not our season
The one & only reason. baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall
See
Wassup
Its funny cause
Yeah?
I never thought this would end
Listen baby, its not gonna end
But then the season changed
Can we, can we bring it back though?
(You were my, you were my, you were my love
You done made, you done made, you done made my world)
Cause you are my girl, & I wanted you to be my world
So Im a do everything to make sure you happy
(Watcha say)
Keep faithful, keep faithful, keep faithful, keep faithful

They may change yeah, they may change, but Im a always be the same, always be the same
Layin on a purple cloud pillow, just chillin
Cant describe the feelin, bout to take off leave a hole in the celilin
Fiends for my music cause my shit dope, only lookin up like my neck broke
Or like a cloud of smoke, gasoline and flame at the end of the rope
Fuckin clown but its not a joke
Pump water gun in shawty pussy let it super soak
Yeah Im feelin myself no materbation
My head blown up I need deflation
Frustion steady pasen and waitin
To put a end to the bullshittin and perpertatin
Me and Eazy in a leauge of our own, use to think my mind was gone
But its clear to see that we on

Seeing you got ritualistic
Cleansing my soul of addiction for now
Cause Im falling apart, yeah
Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I wont mention for now
Cause were falling apart, yeah
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passing up on my old ways
I cant blame you, no, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passing up on my old ways
I cant blame you, no, no, no
Listen
Harder building trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
Cause were falling apart, yeah
Leaving
Youre just doing that to get even
Dont pick up the pieces just leave it for now
They keep falling apart, yeah
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passing up on my old ways
I cant blame you, no, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passing up on my old ways

Yeah
Look
I never been the type to take love
And never ever will I fake love
But maybe we can make love, yeah
I kinda like those things you do
You know I still got that thing for you
And maybe I can teach you a thing or two, yeah
And maybe we can touch a cloud
We might not make our parents prou
But, fuck it
Cause I be on some cool shit
But I aint tryna prove shit
If you aint tryna be down
Then we can just be cool, shit
Forreal though, like
We should leave it to the birds to hide
We might not make it to the other side
But tell me is you down to ride?
Cause theyll miss us, before we miss them
And theyll diss us, no matter what we give them
So like, fuck it
You down?
Or nah?
This is the quest
You are now on cloud number nine
Sometimes, I sit and wonder if it is what you say
You see, I know I got you feeling some kinda way
Im trying to feel at home at that place that you stay
Or we can get it poppin in some shit far away
I still feel like Im on a quest for you
Getting dressed feeling like Im getting dressed for you Opinionated but you make me digress for you
And I know you gotta do whats best for you
So Im
On cloud nine
Up past my bedtime
No rest at the kingdom
Im up in my zone but Im not alone
All that I can think of is
We should get higher
We can get higher
Lets start rollin up on this and lets get higher
Lets get higher
Lets get higher
Lets get higher 
I just wanna say Im yours, Im yours
I just wanna say Im yours, Im yours
I know you think Im playing
But Im yours, Im yours
Im yours, Im yours
I just wanna say Im yours, Im yours
I know you think Im playing
But Im yours, Im yours
You see, I think its dope that
We got two different minds
We got two different paths
And we on two different grinds
We got two different style
And stand on two different ceilings
But damn, some kinda way
We got identical feelings, its like
I been through hell to get right where I am, and
You been through hell to get right where you are
I think its meant to be that were right where we are
So if you ever wander just dont wander too far
Im still
But you wasnt really real
You aint even really fuck with me
All this time passed and the shit still fucks with me
Got me thinking if the shit is what its suppose to be
You said it was good but the shit just sucked to me
And you was just bad luck to me
Could have been the one
But you was just bad luck to me
Ayo
Im the guy thats always tryna get high
And sometimes
I like to leave and be at one with the sky
And thats when
I get to thinking, damn another lonely night
Seem like love not for me
So Im just loving my mic
I been through hell and back
Tryna fill this hole in my heart
And it fails, it just fails
And Im just back at the start
My sanity then departs
And revenge is what Im craving
Bodies dropping, steady plotting
Thinking bout assassination
As my guard gets stronger
Hit-list gets longer
Am I forever alone?
This the shit that I ponder
Are you out there in the world
Or did you already leave it?
If this is what love is
Then shit I dont really need it
So its just back to the mic
And its just back to the grind
No more opening up
No more wasting my time
Ima, ima be up here on a cloud
Til I think its time to re-up on the loud

Its yours
Its yours
Yours your still the one that I adore
Aint much out here to have feelings for
